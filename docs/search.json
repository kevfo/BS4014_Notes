    "section": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry",
    "text": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry\nThis portion of the week’s lecture focuses on cancer origins and proto-oncogenes: genes involved in cell growth and division that could potentially be an oncogene and contribute to cancer when it’s mutated or overexpressed.\n\n1.1.1 The Cell Cycle and Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nStages of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nCells - the building blocks of living organisms - come together to form larger structures called tissues. Cells rest, grow, divide to make more cells, change into specific roles, and eventually die. It’s important for cells to follow this cycle to keep everything working smoothly.\nFurthermore, the human body has 1014 cells. Billions of cells undergo mutations each day.\nSometimes, these mutations can cause the cell to grow or divide vigorously. These are mutant cells. These mutant cells can also invade other cells if left uncontrolled.\n\n\n1.1.2 Origins of Cancer\nThis sub-subsection examines two sources of cancer.\n\n1.1.2.1 Clonal\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations Creating a Cancerouns Cell\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that cancer is not caused by a single mutation. It is the result of many mutations that accumulate over time.\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Molecular\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Mutations on a Hypothetical Gene X\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic demonstrates two main ways by which a gene “Gene X” could be inactivated, thereby causing cancer:\n\nGenetic Gene Inactivation\nIn this scenario, “Gene X” could be vital for restricting cell growth and / or division. If “Gene X” happens to be silenced or inactivated, the cell would have no way of slowing its growth or division.\nAs the cell continues to divide and grow, this may cause cancer if the cells grow uncontrollably and the silenced “Gene X” is allowed to be transmitted to daughter cells.\nDNA Packaging into Heterochromatin\nHeterochromatin is tightly packed DNA that is not very accessible for gene expression. Nonetheless, if a crucial part of DNA involved in overseeing cell growth is silenced or is not as expressed, the processes that the “part of DNA” is involved in could lead to cancer if it causes cells to grow or divide uncontrollably.\nMethylation of “C” Nucleotides\nMethyl groups can attach to the “C” nucleotides of DNA. However, when too many methyl groups attach to these “C” nucleotides, the DNA may not be transcripted properly, possibly leading to cancer as the proteins that control cell growth and division may not be expressed properly.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Molecular Events in Cancer\nWhen normal cells undergo mitosis, telomeres - the ends of the cells’ chromosomes - shorten each time a cell divides. Once the telomere is too short, the cell stops dividing for good. This entire process - in fancy speak - is called replicative cell senescence.\nCanceorus cells don’t undergo replicative cell senescence for one of two reasons:\n\nInactivation of p53 Pathway\nThe p53 pathway is akin to a security system that ensures that everything is well prior to the cell dividing. If this pathway is inactivated, cells could potentially keep dividing and cause a tumor (i.e., cancer).\nMaintaining Telomerase Activity For Too Long\nA telomerase is an enzyme that prevents telomeres from getting shorter with each cell division. When cells don’t stop dividing, this can lead to cancer.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Rb Protein in Cell Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Changes Throughout the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how behavioral changes in Retinoblastoma (i.e., Rb) - a so-called “stop sign” that controls cell division - influences the cell cycle:\n\nWhen cells are done dividing, Rb is activated by phosphatases.\nWhen mitogens - signal proteins - don’t get secreted, Rb “sticks” to other proteins that also control cell growth. This inhibits the cell from dividing as cell growth no longer works.\nWhen signals cause the cell to grow, cyclins and CDKs (i.e., Cyclin-Dependent Kinases) become active. These cyclins and CDKs put phosphate groups on Rb.\nBecause of 3., Rb and another protein called E2F cannot bind together. Certain genes that signal cells to grow become activated.\n\n\n1.1.4.1 Removing Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\nThe end part of Rb - RbC - only connects to E2F when it’s with another protein called DP. When phosphate groups are added to RbC, Rb changes its shape - this causes E2F to not attach to a specific spot on Rb.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Reaction Cycle of Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle of Ras Activation and Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nThe protein Ras in the above figure is a molecular switch that controls signalling pathways involved in growth, survival, and proliferation. The above graphic also shows how Ras behaves in a cell:\n\nGDIs - “caretakers” of Ras - form groups with Ras. These groups are soluble and enable Ras to move between various parts of the cell membrane.\nWhen the Ras has a GDP molecule attached to it, it enters a “resting” mode. A helper called GEF steps in when it’s time for Ras to become active again. GEF helps Ras exchange GDP for GTP - this gives the Ras energy to do its job.\nAt this point, Ras is capable of interacting with other proteins called effectors. These effectors enable Ras to start a chain reaction of signals.\nWhen a protein called GAP binds to Ras, GAP breaks apart Ras and the GTP molecule that it was originally bound to. This is called hydrolysis. Ras goes back to its resting state.\n\n\n1.1.5.1 Examples of Ras Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Ras Mutations and Tumor Causes\n\n\n\n\nThe above table displays some examples of Ras mutations and the kinds of tumors that they can cause.\nTwo structural mutations are covered in this week’s lecture:\n\nG12R Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12R Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nA guanidium group appears here and has new interactions - a salt bridge interaction with the \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate of GTP and the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the T35 amino acid in the figure above.\nThe sidechain of amino acid Q61 also moves away from Ras’ binding pocket, hence GTP is unable to be broken down in this mutant.\nG12V Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12V Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a big distance between the nitrogen backbone of G13 and the \\(\\beta\\)-\\(\\gamma\\) bridging oxygen of GTP.\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Inhibiting Ras Activity\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms to Inhibit Ras\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines some possible approaches to inhibit Ras activity:\n\nStabilization of GTPase-Protein Complexes\nThis refers to finding ways to keep GTPases bound to their GTP molecules for as long as possible. The longer the two entities stay together, Ras activity will not happen.\nInterference with Nucleotide Binding\nRas will be unable to switch between its active and inactivate staes as a result of this, hence downstream pathways don’t get activated.\nIrreversible Covalent Modification\nA chemical group could be attached to GTPases, thereby changing its structure and preventing proper function. If a GTPase is unable to activate Ras, then Ras activity cannot resume.\nInhibition of GTPase-GEF Interactions\nThis directly prevents Ras from being activated, essentially stopping Ras activity.\nInhibition of GTPase-Effector Interactions\nThis disrupts the communications that Ras uses to activate pathways, hence cutting off Ras activity."

These groups carry two retinol binding proteins. When TTR is mutated, this can cause degenrative diseases.\n\n1.2.1 Alzheimer’s Disease (i.e., AD)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Healthy Brain versus a Brain with AD\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes 60% to 70% of dementia cases. 26 million patients suffer from it as of the time of writing.\nAD starts with short term memory loss before going to language problems, disorientation, and losing body functions in the long run (before the patient dies).\n\n1.2.1.1 APP Processing and AD\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Non-Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nAPP is a protein that is processed in our brains in a certain fashion:\n\nA “pair of scissors” \\(\\alpha\\)-secretase cuts APP. A secretase is a protein that cuts transmembrane proteins into smaller parts so that it can be degraded or used elsewhere.\nTwo fragments called APPs\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF are released: APPs\\(\\alpha\\) is released to the outside of the cell.\nAnother “pair of scissors” \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cuts \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF into two more parts: p3 and AICD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nWhen things go awry, \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cleaves \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF to form AICD and A\\(\\beta\\).

These are called off-pathway oligomers and can lead to fibril formation.\n\\(\\beta\\)-Sheet Breakers that Stop Fibril Elongation\nAmyloid fibrils are linked together by structures called \\(\\beta\\)-sheets. Breaking these sheets stops amyloid fibrils from forming.\nDisassembly of Amyloid Fibrils\nDisassembling fibrils can help stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nRefolding\nWhen the proteins that form the fibrils get refolded properly, they no longer form fibrils and also don’t contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nClearance by Chaperons and Antibodies\nWhen chaperones and antibodies work together, they stop amyloid fibrils from sticking together and causing problems. This also prevents amyloid fibril formation."

It’s like when some cells in the body start growing really fast in a weird way. These strange cells can also try to take over other parts of the body, which scientists call spreading.\nWhen these cells move to other places, it’s called metastasizing.

    "text": "2.2 Clonal Origins of Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor Population Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows that tumors grow over time.\nCancer usually starts from just one strange cell that’s not normal. This first weird cell forms what’s called a primary tumor. It’s like the beginning of the problem. This cell has some changes in it that it can pass down to its new cells.\nAs time goes on, more changes happen, and the tumor becomes able to invade and take over other parts. When this tumor spreads to other places, it’s called metastasized, and that’s when it’s called cancer.\n\n2.2.1 Evidence #1: Chromosomal Assembly\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in Chromosome Assembly in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n\nNormal white blood cells look a certain way in terms of their chromosomes, which are like their genetic parts. But in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (i.e., CML), there’s a special problem: a change in the chromosomes that’s unique.\nhis change is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. It happens because parts of two different chromosomes, number 9 and number 22, switch places. This helps doctors tell the difference between regular white blood cells and the ones causing CML.\n\n\n2.2.2 Evidence #2: X Chromosome Inactivation\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Mutations in Normal Adult Embryos\n\n\n\n\nIn adult bodies, one of the X chromosomes can be randomly turned off (see above) - something that happens when the person is an embryo. When scientists look at normal adult tissue, the active and the inactive X chromosome are evenly spread out.\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Mutations in Normal Adult Embryos Causing a Tumor\n\n\n\n\nWhen a tumor is present, the same inactivated chromosome is inactivated.\n\n\n2.2.3 How Cancer Develops\nCancer grows slowly as cells start to act strangely. A tumor forms as these abnormal cells keep changing and growing in number. This creates a group of really bad cells that can take over nearby tissue.\nFirst, a cell becomes mutated by accident, turning into an odd cell. Then, this cell starts to multiply, getting more mutations as it does. This keeps happening, and the cell multiplies even more, with more mutations each time. Finally, these mutated cells grow out of control and start invading nearby tissue, which can be really harmful.\nDuring a regular human life, the body goes through around 1016 cell divisions. Sometimes, mutagens - things that can cause mutations - are present in the environment. The natural rate of mutations that happen on their own is about 1 in every 10-6 genes during each cell division. This means that every gene can undergo a mutation about 1010 times.\n\n\n2.2.4 Basis for Clonal Origins of Cancer\nThere are two case studies listed here:\n\nStudy of Colon Cancer in Women in 1987 England\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Incidence over Age\n\n\n\n\nIn 1987, researchers looked at colon cancer cases in women in England. They found that as women get older, the chances of getting colon cancer increase a lot, which is shown in a graph.\nStudy of Workers Exposed to Carcinogens in 1950s\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Bladder Cancer Patients Among Workers Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above is about a group of 78 workers in a chemical industry who were exposed to a harmful substance called a carcinogen, specifically 2-naphthylamine.\nIt’s showing how long it took for these workers to develop bladder cancer after being exposed to the carcinogen. What the graph shows is that the workers who were exposed to the carcinogen for more years tended to get cancer earlier, and their cancer grew faster compared to those with less exposure."

The stroma is like a scaffold for the tumor. The cancer cells release special proteins and enzymes that cause changes in the stroma.\nThe cells in the stroma help the cancer cells grow and spread by responding to these proteins and enzymes. It’s like a conversation between the cancer cells and their surroundings that helps the cancer to grow."

    "section": "2.4 Identifying Cancer-Causing Genes",
    "text": "2.4 Identifying Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Discovery of Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\nBack in the 1970s, people thought that cancer cells were like changed or mutant cells. This led scientists to look for genes that went through mutations while tumors were forming. But it was tough because the human genetic code was really complicated.\nCancer doesn’t usually happen because of just one change; it needs many different mutations and changes. Even now, there’s no easy way to search for genes that control cancer growth in a systematic manner. Instead, finding these important genes happened in a roundabout way, using experiments that weren’t directly focused on them.\n\n2.4.1 Mechanisms of Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nKinds of Cancer-Causing Genes and Their Mutations\n\n\n\n\nIn the above grahpic, something called an overactivity mutation can lead to cancer. In this kind of mutation, a single change happens in a gene, and it becomes an oncogene: a gene with the potential to cause cancer. This oncogene becomes more active and encourages cells to change in a way that can lead to cancer. This change is strong and directly makes cells act in a cancerous way. It’s like a dominant force that causes cancer.\nOn the other hand, something called an underactivity mutation can also lead to cancer. These mutations affect genes called tumor suppressor genes. When a first mutation happens, it doesn’t really show an effect because we usually have two copies of each gene. But if a second mutation occurs, inactivating the second copy of the gene, it can turn off the tumor-suppressing abilities of that gene. When both copies are inactive due to these mutations, it can lead to the promotion of cell changes that are linked to cancer. This type of change is recessive, and it directly causes cancer by disrupting the normal regulation of cell growth.\n\n\n2.4.2 Activating Proto-Oncogenes\n\n\n\n\n\nWays Proto-Oncogenes Can Cause Cancer\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main ways this can happen. First, the organization of these proto-oncogenes can change, making them create abnormal proteins with strange functions. Second, the control over how these genes are used can change, causing them to make too much of certain proteins that promote cell growth. These changes can make cells behave in unhealthy ways that might lead to cancer.\nA proto-oncogene can also lead to cancer in one of three ways:\n\nPoint Mutations\nA small change in the DNA can either lead to a normal amount of a hyperactive protein being produced (i.e., protein-coding mutation) or the overproduction of a normal protein.\nGene Amplification\nMistakes in the DNA produce extra copies of the gene.\nChromosomal Translation\nBreaking and rejoining DNA can produce changes in proteins. If this rejoining happens in regulatory DNA, then the normal protein can be made too much. Otherwise, a hyperactive fusion protein can be made if this happens in protein-coding DNA.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Experiments Demonstrating Proto-Oncogene Activation\nThere are three experiments mentioned:\n\n2.4.3.1 Oncogene Identification Using Mouse Fibroblast Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Results from Murine Fibroblast Cells\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers took the DNA from normal cells and broke it into smaller pieces. Then, they put these DNA pieces into cells that were growing in a dish. The normal cells in the dish usually stop growing when they touch each other. Once they cover the dish in a single layer, they don’t keep multiplying.\nIn cells with the proto-oncogenes turned on, the researchers took the DNA from these cancerous cells and broke it into smaller pieces. They then put these DNA pieces into cells growing in a dish. The cells with the cancer-causing genes didn’t pay attention to the usual growth restraints. Instead, they started growing in an abnormal way, piling up on each other. Each pile, called a colony, came from just one starting cell. This shows how these genes can make cells act in a cancerous manner.\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Amplification of the N-myc Proto-Oncogene\n\n\n\n\n\nAmplification of the N-myc Gene\n\n\n\n\nScientists sometimes study chromosomes using two methods:\n\nG-banding\nCertain parts of the DNA get stained more or less. The staining helps identify regions with different DNA content.\nR-banding\nDifferent parts of the DNA are stained more.\n\nWhen certain regions are overactive and have a lot of DNA, they’re called Homogeneously Staining Regions (i.e., HSRs). These HSRs can sometimes be removed and become Double Minutes (i.e., DMs), which can even move to other chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of Cancers Associated with Gene Amplification\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of genes that can be overly active due to these changes are c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc.\n\n\n2.4.3.3 Chromosomal Translations\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Chromosomal Translocations\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic mentions two kinds of translocations:\n\nReciprocal Translocation\nTwo different parts of two different chromosomes are exchanged.\nRobertsonian (i.e., non-reciprocal) Translocation\nAn entire chromosome is attached to another at the centromere: the center of the chromosome.\n\n\n2.4.3.3.1 Example 1: Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (Philadelphia Chromosome)\n\n\n\n\n\nChromosomal Translocation in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n\nUsually, there are two genes named abl and bcr, and they’re on different chromosomes (chromosome 9 and 22). But sometimes, things change. The chromosomes break and swap places in a process via Robertsonian translocation. This makes the abl gene and the bcr gene stick together on one chromosome. This special chromosome is called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison Between Normal Chromosomes and Philadelphia Chromosomes\n\n\n\n\nThe breakpoint cluster region protein (i.e., bcr) is also known by another name - renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-26.\nThere’s a proto-oncogene called c-abl on chromosome 9. In certain cases, this gene moves to a specific spot called the breakpoint cluster region (i.e., bcr) on chromosome 22. When this happens, something special takes place. A new kind of tyrosine kinase forms, which works on its own without following the usual rules. This change is a bit like a switch getting flipped, and it’s part of why things go wrong in cancer.\n\n\n2.4.3.3.2 Example 2: Burkitt’s lymphoma - High-Grade B-Lymphocyte Neoplasm\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Diagrams of Burkitt’s Lymphoma\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a gene called c-myc, and it’s usually quiet in certain blood cells. But sometimes, things get mixed up. There’s a kind of change called T(8;14) translocation, and it makes c-myc wake up when it shouldn’t. This happens because c-myc moves closer to a signal that tells it to start working.\nIt’s like a switch turning on that gene all the time, and this makes the cell keep making a protein called c-myc. It’s not how it’s supposed to be, but because of this change, the cell acts differently."

These machines have a built-in safety feature” that keeps them from working all the time.\nThat said, there’s a phosphate group that, when removed, makes the kinase’s structure more flexible. Another part, like a button, gets pressed when an activating signal attaches to it. This signal binds to the protein in a special spot called the SH3 domain.\nNow, because of this signal, the protein becomes a kinase, a part that can activate other parts. It’s like a switch turning on. With this newfound power, the protein can do something called phosphorylation, which is like adding a tiny tag to another part of the protein. This helps it become active and ready to do its job.\n\n2.5.1 Domains of p210 Abl-Bcr Fusion Protein\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Portions of the p210 Abl-Bcr Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things to note about this protein:\n\nBCR Portion\nThis part also has a special spot called tyrosine 177 that acts like a hook for another protein called Grb-2. It’s like they link up. This protein also knows how to do something called phosphorylation, which is like putting little tags on other parts of the protein.\nThis protein has a part that’s like a switch for another type of activity called a kinase. Imagine it’s like a control button. And there’s one more part that’s like a tool. This tool helps the protein communicate and send signals, sort of like sending messages. All these parts together make the protein work in a special way.\nABL Portion\nThis part of the protein is like a team of different parts that work together. Imagine it’s like a superhero team. Some parts are like special detectors, called SH3 and SH2, that help the protein know when things are happening around it.\nThere’s also a part called SH1, which is like the captain of the team. It’s good at changing things, kind of like a leader. Then there’s another part that helps the protein find its way to the nucleus, which is like the command center of the cell. It’s like a secret key that helps the protein go where it’s needed.\nFinally, this protein has parts that are like tools. These tools let the protein grab onto DNA and actin, which are like the building blocks and support beams of the cell. All these parts team up to make the protein do important jobs in the cell.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Abl-Bcr Protein Signalling in Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Abl-Bcr Protein Causes CML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Discovery of Tumor Suppressor Genes\nScientists initially thought that when a gene changes, it adds new information instead of taking information away.\nHowever, two approaches outlined by Henry Harris and George Klein showed otherwise:\n\nApproach #1\nScientists did an experiment with mice cells. They mixed cells that cause cancer with cells that don’t. The new cells they got made fewer tumors than the cancer cells alone. Regular cells have genes that stop cancer-like behavior. The scientists thought that cancer might happen when certain genes are missing, not when new genes appear.\nApproach #2\nWhen two types of cells were combined, they noticed that the new cells started acting like cancer cells. They mixed normal fibroblasts with HeLa cells, which are from cervical cancer. What’s interesting is that when these new cells turned cancerous, it was linked to a missing chromosome 11. When they put back the missing part using cells from normal tissue, the cancer behavior stopped. This suggests that there might be a “stop-cancer” gene on chromosome 11. So, the loss of this gene might be causing the cancer-like behavior by removing something important.\n\nSo, the conclusion was that tumor-suppressor genes cause genetic information to be loss, not gained.\n\n\n2.5.4 Functions of Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal versus Mutated Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\nGenes that can stop tumors from growing by comparing normal cells and cancer cells. These genes have different jobs.\nSome are like “gatekeepers” that stop cells from growing too much or make them die if they’re damaged. Others are like “caretakers” that fix DNA when it’s broken.\nThese genes tell cells to make proteins that slow down how much they grow and divide. So, a bunch of these genes working together in normal cells make sure cells don’t go crazy. But if one of these genes is changed by a mutation, it can’t control the cell anymore, and it grows and divides a lot. This can lead to cancer.\n\n\n2.5.5 Inactivating Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Events that Inactivate Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding genetic events, there are also three other ways that this can happen:\n\nRecessive Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor Suppressor Genes Being Inactivated\n\n\n\n\nIf only one gene is lost, the cell keeps working fine. But for cancer to happen, both sets of genes from our parents must change. This happens through different changes in the genes and how they’re used. It’s like a two-step process where changes in the genes and how they work lead to the loss of tumor suppressor gene function in cancer cells.\nPutative and Cloned Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Locations and Cancers Caused by Gene Mutations\n\n\n\n\n“Putative and Cloned Tumor Suppressor Genes” means scientists have found some genes that might stop cancer and they’ve also identified some genes that definitely do.\nImagine these genes as “superheroes” that try to prevent cells from turning into cancer. The “putative” genes are like potential heroes that scientists think might help, but they’re still checking if they’re the real deal.\nOn the other hand, the “cloned” genes are the confirmed heroes. Scientists have shown that these genes really can stop cells from going cancerous. So, it’s like scientists are assembling a team of gene superheroes to fight against cancer, with some in the “might-be” stage and others already in action.\nIntra-Cellular Localization of Tumor Suppressor Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Locations and Cancers Caused by Gene Mutations\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic mentions numerous proteins that can all keep tumor suppressor genes in the same area (i.e., localization):\n\nCell Surface and Cell Matrix Molecules: NF2, APC, and DCC\nThese are genes that help prevent cells from becoming cancerous. When these genes don’t work properly, they can’t stop cells from growing uncontrollably, which can lead to tumors forming.\nNormally, cells “listen” to their neighbors and know when to stop growing. But in cancer, this communication can break down, and cells might grow without any brakes.\nSignal Transduction: NF1 and GAP\nThis point is talking about how cells communicate within themselves. The Neurofibromatosis1 (i.e., NF1) protein helps control this communication, especially with a protein called Ras. When NF1 doesn’t work right, it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.\nTranscription Regulation: Rb and p53\nCells have a guardian called p53 that monitors their DNA. If it finds damaged DNA, it can order the cell to self-destruct (apoptosis) to prevent problems from spreading. Moreover, cells have “traffic lights” called Rb proteins that tell them when to stop growing. In cancer, these “lights” might not work properly, so cells keep growing when they shouldn’t.\n\n\nAll of the mentioned proteins are crucial to proper functioning of the cell. If these proteins aren’t where they should be or if they don’t work as they should, cells can start growing uncontrollably, leading to the development of tumors and cancer."
