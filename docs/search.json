    "section": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry",
    "text": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry\nThis portion of the week’s lecture focuses on cancer origins and proto-oncogenes: genes involved in cell growth and division that could potentially be an oncogene and contribute to cancer when it’s mutated or overexpressed.\n\n1.1.1 The Cell Cycle and Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nStages of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nCells - the building blocks of living organisms - come together to form larger structures called tissues. Cells rest, grow, divide to make more cells, change into specific roles, and eventually die. It’s important for cells to follow this cycle to keep everything working smoothly.\nFurthermore, the human body has 1014 cells. Billions of cells undergo mutations each day.\nSometimes, these mutations can cause the cell to grow or divide vigorously. These are mutant cells. These mutant cells can also invade other cells if left uncontrolled.\n\n\n1.1.2 Origins of Cancer\nThis sub-subsection examines two sources of cancer.\n\n1.1.2.1 Clonal\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations Creating a Cancerouns Cell\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that cancer is not caused by a single mutation. It is the result of many mutations that accumulate over time.\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Molecular\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Mutations on a Hypothetical Gene X\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic demonstrates two main ways by which a gene “Gene X” could be inactivated, thereby causing cancer:\n\nGenetic Gene Inactivation\nIn this scenario, “Gene X” could be vital for restricting cell growth and / or division. If “Gene X” happens to be silenced or inactivated, the cell would have no way of slowing its growth or division.\nAs the cell continues to divide and grow, this may cause cancer if the cells grow uncontrollably and the silenced “Gene X” is allowed to be transmitted to daughter cells.\nDNA Packaging into Heterochromatin\nHeterochromatin is tightly packed DNA that is not very accessible for gene expression. Nonetheless, if a crucial part of DNA involved in overseeing cell growth is silenced or is not as expressed, the processes that the “part of DNA” is involved in could lead to cancer if it causes cells to grow or divide uncontrollably.\nMethylation of “C” Nucleotides\nMethyl groups can attach to the “C” nucleotides of DNA. However, when too many methyl groups attach to these “C” nucleotides, the DNA may not be transcripted properly, possibly leading to cancer as the proteins that control cell growth and division may not be expressed properly.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Molecular Events in Cancer\nWhen normal cells undergo mitosis, telomeres - the ends of the cells’ chromosomes - shorten each time a cell divides. Once the telomere is too short, the cell stops dividing for good. This entire process - in fancy speak - is called replicative cell senescence.\nCanceorus cells don’t undergo replicative cell senescence for one of two reasons:\n\nInactivation of p53 Pathway\nThe p53 pathway is akin to a security system that ensures that everything is well prior to the cell dividing. If this pathway is inactivated, cells could potentially keep dividing and cause a tumor (i.e., cancer).\nMaintaining Telomerase Activity For Too Long\nA telomerase is an enzyme that prevents telomeres from getting shorter with each cell division. When cells don’t stop dividing, this can lead to cancer.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Rb Protein in Cell Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Changes Throughout the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how behavioral changes in Retinoblastoma (i.e., Rb) - a so-called “stop sign” that controls cell division - influences the cell cycle:\n\nWhen cells are done dividing, Rb is activated by phosphatases.\nWhen mitogens - signal proteins - don’t get secreted, Rb “sticks” to other proteins that also control cell growth. This inhibits the cell from dividing as cell growth no longer works.\nWhen signals cause the cell to grow, cyclins and CDKs (i.e., Cyclin-Dependent Kinases) become active. These cyclins and CDKs put phosphate groups on Rb.\nBecause of 3., Rb and another protein called E2F cannot bind together. Certain genes that signal cells to grow become activated.\n\n\n1.1.4.1 Removing Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\nThe end part of Rb - RbC - only connects to E2F when it’s with another protein called DP. When phosphate groups are added to RbC, Rb changes its shape - this causes E2F to not attach to a specific spot on Rb.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Reaction Cycle of Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle of Ras Activation and Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nThe protein Ras in the above figure is a molecular switch that controls signalling pathways involved in growth, survival, and proliferation. The above graphic also shows how Ras behaves in a cell:\n\nGDIs - “caretakers” of Ras - form groups with Ras. These groups are soluble and enable Ras to move between various parts of the cell membrane.\nWhen the Ras has a GDP molecule attached to it, it enters a “resting” mode. A helper called GEF steps in when it’s time for Ras to become active again. GEF helps Ras exchange GDP for GTP - this gives the Ras energy to do its job.\nAt this point, Ras is capable of interacting with other proteins called effectors. These effectors enable Ras to start a chain reaction of signals.\nWhen a protein called GAP binds to Ras, GAP breaks apart Ras and the GTP molecule that it was originally bound to. This is called hydrolysis. Ras goes back to its resting state.\n\n\n1.1.5.1 Examples of Ras Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Ras Mutations and Tumor Causes\n\n\n\n\nThe above table displays some examples of Ras mutations and the kinds of tumors that they can cause.\nTwo structural mutations are covered in this week’s lecture:\n\nG12R Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12R Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nA guanidium group appears here and has new interactions - a salt bridge interaction with the \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate of GTP and the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the T35 amino acid in the figure above.\nThe sidechain of amino acid Q61 also moves away from Ras’ binding pocket, hence GTP is unable to be broken down in this mutant.\nG12V Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12V Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a big distance between the nitrogen backbone of G13 and the \\(\\beta\\)-\\(\\gamma\\) bridging oxygen of GTP.\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Inhibiting Ras Activity\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms to Inhibit Ras\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines some possible approaches to inhibit Ras activity:\n\nStabilization of GTPase-Protein Complexes\nThis refers to finding ways to keep GTPases bound to their GTP molecules for as long as possible. The longer the two entities stay together, Ras activity will not happen.\nInterference with Nucleotide Binding\nRas will be unable to switch between its active and inactivate staes as a result of this, hence downstream pathways don’t get activated.\nIrreversible Covalent Modification\nA chemical group could be attached to GTPases, thereby changing its structure and preventing proper function. If a GTPase is unable to activate Ras, then Ras activity cannot resume.\nInhibition of GTPase-GEF Interactions\nThis directly prevents Ras from being activated, essentially stopping Ras activity.\nInhibition of GTPase-Effector Interactions\nThis disrupts the communications that Ras uses to activate pathways, hence cutting off Ras activity."

These groups carry two retinol binding proteins. When TTR is mutated, this can cause degenrative diseases.\n\n1.2.1 Alzheimer’s Disease (i.e., AD)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Healthy Brain versus a Brain with AD\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes 60% to 70% of dementia cases. 26 million patients suffer from it as of the time of writing.\nAD starts with short term memory loss before going to language problems, disorientation, and losing body functions in the long run (before the patient dies).\n\n1.2.1.1 APP Processing and AD\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Non-Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nAPP is a protein that is processed in our brains in a certain fashion:\n\nA “pair of scissors” \\(\\alpha\\)-secretase cuts APP. A secretase is a protein that cuts transmembrane proteins into smaller parts so that it can be degraded or used elsewhere.\nTwo fragments called APPs\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF are released: APPs\\(\\alpha\\) is released to the outside of the cell.\nAnother “pair of scissors” \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cuts \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF into two more parts: p3 and AICD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nWhen things go awry, \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cleaves \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF to form AICD and A\\(\\beta\\).

These are called off-pathway oligomers and can lead to fibril formation.\n\\(\\beta\\)-Sheet Breakers that Stop Fibril Elongation\nAmyloid fibrils are linked together by structures called \\(\\beta\\)-sheets. Breaking these sheets stops amyloid fibrils from forming.\nDisassembly of Amyloid Fibrils\nDisassembling fibrils can help stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nRefolding\nWhen the proteins that form the fibrils get refolded properly, they no longer form fibrils and also don’t contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nClearance by Chaperons and Antibodies\nWhen chaperones and antibodies work together, they stop amyloid fibrils from sticking together and causing problems. This also prevents amyloid fibril formation."

It’s like when some cells in the body start growing really fast in a weird way.

    "text": "2.2 Clonal Origins of Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor Population Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows that tumors grow over time.\nCancer usually starts from just one strange cell that’s not normal. This first weird cell forms what’s called a primary tumor. It’s like the beginning of the problem. This cell has some changes in it that it can pass down to its new cells.\nAs time goes on, more changes happen, and the tumor becomes able to invade and take over other parts. When this tumor spreads to other places, it’s called metastasized, and that’s when it’s called cancer.\n\n2.2.1 Evidence #1: Chromosomal Assembly\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in Chromosome Assembly in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n\nNormal white blood cells look a certain way in terms of their chromosomes, which are like their genetic parts. But in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (i.e., CML), there’s a special problem: a change in the chromosomes that’s unique.\nhis change is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. It happens because parts of two different chromosomes, number 9 and number 22, switch places. This helps doctors tell the difference between regular white blood cells and the ones causing CML.\n\n\n2.2.2 Evidence #2: X Chromosome Inactivation\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Mutations in Normal Adult Embryos\n\n\n\n\nIn adult bodies, one of the X chromosomes can be randomly turned off (see above) - something that happens when the person is an embryo. When scientists look at normal adult tissue, the active and the inactive X chromosome are evenly spread out.\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Mutations in Normal Adult Embryos Causing a Tumor\n\n\n\n\nWhen a tumor is present, the same inactivated chromosome is inactivated.\n\n\n2.2.3 How Cancer Develops\nCancer grows slowly as cells start to act strangely. A tumor forms as these abnormal cells keep changing and growing in number. This creates a group of really bad cells that can take over nearby tissue.\nFirst, a cell becomes mutated by accident, turning into an odd cell. Then, this cell starts to multiply, getting more mutations as it does. This keeps happening, and the cell multiplies even more, with more mutations each time. Finally, these mutated cells grow out of control and start invading nearby tissue, which can be really harmful.\nDuring a regular human life, the body goes through around 1016 cell divisions. Sometimes, mutagens - things that can cause mutations - are present in the environment. The natural rate of mutations that happen on their own is about 1 in every 10-6 genes during each cell division. This means that every gene can undergo a mutation about 1010 times.\n\n\n2.2.4 Basis for Clonal Origins of Cancer\nThere are two case studies listed here:\n\nStudy of Colon Cancer in Women in 1987 England\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Incidence over Age\n\n\n\n\nIn 1987, researchers looked at colon cancer cases in women in England. They found that as women get older, the chances of getting colon cancer increase a lot, which is shown in a graph.\nStudy of Workers Exposed to Carcinogens in 1950s\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Bladder Cancer Patients Among Workers Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above is about a group of 78 workers in a chemical industry who were exposed to a harmful substance called a carcinogen, specifically 2-naphthylamine.\nIt’s showing how long it took for these workers to develop bladder cancer after being exposed to the carcinogen. What the graph shows is that the workers who were exposed to the carcinogen for more years tended to get cancer earlier, and their cancer grew faster compared to those with less exposure."

The stroma is like a scaffold for the tumor. The cancer cells release special proteins and enzymes that cause changes in the stroma.\nThe cells in the stroma help the cancer cells grow and spread by responding to these proteins and enzymes. It’s like a conversation between the cancer cells and their surroundings that helps the cancer to grow."

    "section": "2.4 Identifying Cancer-Causing Genes",
    "text": "2.4 Identifying Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Discovery of Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\nBack in the 1970s, people thought that cancer cells were like changed or mutant cells. This led scientists to look for genes that went through mutations while tumors were forming. But it was tough because the human genetic code was really complicated.\nCancer doesn’t usually happen because of just one change; it needs many different mutations and changes. Even now, there’s no easy way to search for genes that control cancer growth in a systematic manner. Instead, finding these important genes happened in a roundabout way, using experiments that weren’t directly focused on them.\n\n2.4.1 Mechanisms of Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nKinds of Cancer-Causing Genes and Their Mutations\n\n\n\n\nIn the above grahpic, something called an overactivity mutation can lead to cancer. In this kind of mutation, a single change happens in a gene, and it becomes an oncogene: a gene with the potential to cause cancer. This oncogene becomes more active and encourages cells to change in a way that can lead to cancer. This change is strong and directly makes cells act in a cancerous way. It’s like a dominant force that causes cancer.\nOn the other hand, something called an underactivity mutation can also lead to cancer. These mutations affect genes called tumor suppressor genes. When a first mutation happens, it doesn’t really show an effect because we usually have two copies of each gene. But if a second mutation occurs, inactivating the second copy of the gene, it can turn off the tumor-suppressing abilities of that gene. When both copies are inactive due to these mutations, it can lead to the promotion of cell changes that are linked to cancer. This type of change is recessive, and it directly causes cancer by disrupting the normal regulation of cell growth.\n\n\n2.4.2 Activating Proto-Oncogenes\n\n\n\n\n\nWays Proto-Oncogenes Can Cause Cancer\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main ways this can happen. First, the organization of these proto-oncogenes can change, making them create abnormal proteins with strange functions. Second, the control over how these genes are used can change, causing them to make too much of certain proteins that promote cell growth. These changes can make cells behave in unhealthy ways that might lead to cancer.\nA proto-oncogene can also lead to cancer in one of three ways:\n\nPoint Mutations\nA small change in the DNA can either lead to a normal amount of a hyperactive protein being produced (i.e., protein-coding mutation) or the overproduction of a normal protein.\nGene Amplification\nMistakes in the DNA produce extra copies of the gene.\nChromosomal Translation\nBreaking and rejoining DNA can produce changes in proteins. If this rejoining happens in regulatory DNA, then the normal protein can be made too much. Otherwise, a hyperactive fusion protein can be made if this happens in protein-coding DNA.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Experiments Demonstrating Proto-Oncogene Activation\nThere are three experiments mentioned:\n\n2.4.3.1 Oncogene Identification Using Mouse Fibroblast Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Results from Murine Fibroblast Cells\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers took the DNA from normal cells and broke it into smaller pieces. Then, they put these DNA pieces into cells that were growing in a dish. The normal cells in the dish usually stop growing when they touch each other. Once they cover the dish in a single layer, they don’t keep multiplying.\nIn cells with the proto-oncogenes turned on, the researchers took the DNA from these cancerous cells and broke it into smaller pieces. They then put these DNA pieces into cells growing in a dish. The cells with the cancer-causing genes didn’t pay attention to the usual growth restraints. Instead, they started growing in an abnormal way, piling up on each other. Each pile, called a colony, came from just one starting cell. This shows how these genes can make cells act in a cancerous manner.\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Amplification of the N-myc Proto-Oncogene\n\n\n\n\n\nAmplification of the N-myc Gene\n\n\n\n\nScientists sometimes study chromosomes using two methods:\n\nG-banding\nCertain parts of the DNA get stained more or less. The staining helps identify regions with different DNA content.\nR-banding\nDifferent parts of the DNA are stained more.\n\nWhen certain regions are overactive and have a lot of DNA, they’re called Homogeneously Staining Regions (i.e., HSRs). These HSRs can sometimes be removed and become Double Minutes (i.e., DMs), which can even move to other chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of Cancers Associated with Gene Amplification\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of genes that can be overly active due to these changes are c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc.\n\n\n2.4.3.3 Chromosomal Translations\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Chromosomal Translocations\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic mentions two kinds of translocations:\n\nReciprocal Translocation\nTwo different parts of two different chromosomes are exchanged.\nRobertsonian (i.e., non-reciprocal) Translocation\nAn entire chromosome is attached to another at the centromere: the center of the chromosome.\n\n\n2.4.3.3.1 Example 1: Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (Philadelphia Chromosome)\n\n\n\n\n\nChromosomal Translocation in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n\nUsually, there are two genes named abl and bcr, and they’re on different chromosomes (chromosome 9 and 22). But sometimes, things change. The chromosomes break and swap places in a process via Robertsonian translocation. This makes the abl gene and the bcr gene stick together on one chromosome. This special chromosome is called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison Between Normal Chromosomes and Philadelphia Chromosomes\n\n\n\n\nThe breakpoint cluster region protein (i.e., bcr) is also known by another name - renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-26.\nThere’s a proto-oncogene called c-abl on chromosome 9. In certain cases, this gene moves to a specific spot called the breakpoint cluster region (i.e., bcr) on chromosome 22. When this happens, something special takes place. A new kind of tyrosine kinase forms, which works on its own without following the usual rules. This change is a bit like a switch getting flipped, and it’s part of why things go wrong in cancer.\n\n\n2.4.3.3.2 Example 2: Burkitt’s lymphoma - High-Grade B-Lymphocyte Neoplasm\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Diagrams of Burkitt’s Lymphoma\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a gene called c-myc, and it’s usually quiet in certain blood cells. But sometimes, things get mixed up. There’s a kind of change called T(8;14) translocation, and it makes c-myc wake up when it shouldn’t. This happens because c-myc moves closer to a signal that tells it to start working.\nIt’s like a switch turning on that gene all the time, and this makes the cell keep making a protein called c-myc. It’s not how it’s supposed to be, but because of this change, the cell acts differently."

These machines have a built-in safety feature” that keeps them from working all the time.\nThat said, there’s a phosphate group that, when removed, makes the kinase’s structure more flexible. Another part, like a button, gets pressed when an activating signal attaches to it. This signal binds to the protein in a special spot called the SH3 domain.\nNow, because of this signal, the protein becomes a kinase, a part that can activate other parts. It’s like a switch turning on. With this newfound power, the protein can do something called phosphorylation, which is like adding a tiny tag to another part of the protein. This helps it become active and ready to do its job.\n\n2.5.1 Domains of p210 Abl-Bcr Fusion Protein\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Portions of the p210 Abl-Bcr Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things to note about this protein:\n\nBCR Portion\nThis part also has a special spot called tyrosine 177 that acts like a hook for another protein called Grb-2. It’s like they link up. This protein also knows how to do something called phosphorylation, which is like putting little tags on other parts of the protein.\nThis protein has a part that’s like a switch for another type of activity called a kinase. Imagine it’s like a control button. And there’s one more part that’s like a tool. This tool helps the protein communicate and send signals, sort of like sending messages. All these parts together make the protein work in a special way.\nABL Portion\nThis part of the protein is like a team of different parts that work together. Imagine it’s like a superhero team. Some parts are like special detectors, called SH3 and SH2, that help the protein know when things are happening around it.\nThere’s also a part called SH1, which is like the captain of the team. It’s good at changing things, kind of like a leader. Then there’s another part that helps the protein find its way to the nucleus, which is like the command center of the cell. It’s like a secret key that helps the protein go where it’s needed.\nFinally, this protein has parts that are like tools. These tools let the protein grab onto DNA and actin, which are like the building blocks and support beams of the cell. All these parts team up to make the protein do important jobs in the cell.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Abl-Bcr Protein Signalling in Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Abl-Bcr Protein Causes CML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Discovery of Tumor Suppressor Genes\nScientists initially thought that when a gene changes, it adds new information instead of taking information away.\nHowever, two approaches outlined by Henry Harris and George Klein showed otherwise:\n\nApproach #1\nScientists did an experiment with mice cells. They mixed cells that cause cancer with cells that don’t. The new cells they got made fewer tumors than the cancer cells alone. Regular cells have genes that stop cancer-like behavior. The scientists thought that cancer might happen when certain genes are missing, not when new genes appear.\nApproach #2\nWhen two types of cells were combined, they noticed that the new cells started acting like cancer cells. They mixed normal fibroblasts with HeLa cells, which are from cervical cancer. What’s interesting is that when these new cells turned cancerous, it was linked to a missing chromosome 11. When they put back the missing part using cells from normal tissue, the cancer behavior stopped. This suggests that there might be a “stop-cancer” gene on chromosome 11. So, the loss of this gene might be causing the cancer-like behavior by removing something important.\n\nSo, the conclusion was that tumor-suppressor genes cause genetic information to be loss, not gained.\n\n\n2.5.4 Functions of Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal versus Mutated Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\nGenes that can stop tumors from growing by comparing normal cells and cancer cells. These genes have different jobs.\nSome are like “gatekeepers” that stop cells from growing too much or make them die if they’re damaged. Others are like “caretakers” that fix DNA when it’s broken.\nThese genes tell cells to make proteins that slow down how much they grow and divide. So, a bunch of these genes working together in normal cells make sure cells don’t go crazy. But if one of these genes is changed by a mutation, it can’t control the cell anymore, and it grows and divides a lot. This can lead to cancer.\n\n\n2.5.5 Inactivating Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Events that Inactivate Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding genetic events, there are also three other ways that this can happen:\n\nRecessive Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor Suppressor Genes Being Inactivated\n\n\n\n\nIf only one gene is lost, the cell keeps working fine. But for cancer to happen, both sets of genes from our parents must change. This happens through different changes in the genes and how they’re used. It’s like a two-step process where changes in the genes and how they work lead to the loss of tumor suppressor gene function in cancer cells.\nPutative and Cloned Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Locations and Cancers Caused by Gene Mutations\n\n\n\n\n“Putative and Cloned Tumor Suppressor Genes” means scientists have found some genes that might stop cancer and they’ve also identified some genes that definitely do.\nImagine these genes as “superheroes” that try to prevent cells from turning into cancer. The “putative” genes are like potential heroes that scientists think might help, but they’re still checking if they’re the real deal.\nOn the other hand, the “cloned” genes are the confirmed heroes. Scientists have shown that these genes really can stop cells from going cancerous. So, it’s like scientists are assembling a team of gene superheroes to fight against cancer, with some in the “might-be” stage and others already in action.\nIntra-Cellular Localization of Tumor Suppressor Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Locations and Cancers Caused by Gene Mutations\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic mentions numerous proteins that can all keep tumor suppressor genes in the same area (i.e., localization):\n\nCell Surface and Cell Matrix Molecules: NF2, APC, and DCC\nThese are genes that help prevent cells from becoming cancerous. When these genes don’t work properly, they can’t stop cells from growing uncontrollably, which can lead to tumors forming.\nNormally, cells “listen” to their neighbors and know when to stop growing. But in cancer, this communication can break down, and cells might grow without any brakes.\nSignal Transduction: NF1 and GAP\nThis point is talking about how cells communicate within themselves. The Neurofibromatosis1 (i.e., NF1) protein helps control this communication, especially with a protein called Ras. When NF1 doesn’t work right, it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.\nTranscription Regulation: Rb and p53\nCells have a guardian called p53 that monitors their DNA. If it finds damaged DNA, it can order the cell to self-destruct (apoptosis) to prevent problems from spreading. Moreover, cells have “traffic lights” called Rb proteins that tell them when to stop growing. In cancer, these “lights” might not work properly, so cells keep growing when they shouldn’t.\n\n\nAll of the mentioned proteins are crucial to proper functioning of the cell. If these proteins aren’t where they should be or if they don’t work as they should, cells can start growing uncontrollably, leading to the development of tumors and cancer."

It forms quickly in the immature cells of the retina, which is the part of the eye responsible for detecting light.\nThis cancer is quite rare, occurring in about 1 child out of every 20,000 children. It’s the most common malignant eye cancer found in kids. Interestingly, almost half of the children with retinoblastoma have a genetic mutation on chromosome 13 (gene 13q14) that is present from birth.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Retinoblastoma can be Inherited\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines two ways that a child can get retinoblastoma:\n\nHereditary\nThis means that the gene changes that lead to retinoblastoma are passed down in the family. When someone has hereditary retinoblastoma, they are born with a gene change that makes them more likely to develop this type of eye cancer. This gene change can be found in every cell of their body. Because of this, both eyes are often at risk of getting cancer. People with hereditary retinoblastoma have a higher chance of developing the cancer at a younger age, and they might have other family members who also had this type of cancer.\nNon-hereditary\nThe gene changes that cause the cancer happen by chance and are not passed down from parents. These changes occur in the early stages of a person’s life, often in just one eye.\nUnlike hereditary retinoblastoma, only one eye is usually affected. People with non-hereditary retinoblastoma don’t have the same high risk of developing the cancer in both eyes, and they are less likely to have family members with the same type of cancer.\n\nIf a cell inactivates a copy of its retinoblastoma genes (i.e., Rb genes), then all’s still good as there’s a backup copy."

    "section": "3.2 The Rb Gene",
    "text": "3.2 The Rb Gene\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Roles of Rb Gene Inactivation in Various Cancers\n\n\n\n\nThe Retinoblastoma (i.e., Rb) gene acts as a vital tumor suppressor, particularly in cases of retinoblastoma, a type of retina cancer. This gene was the first identified phenotypic tumor suppressor.\nIts role is crucial in controlling the cell cycle and the advancement of tumors. It holds a significant position in the cell cycle by stopping the transition from G1 to S phase, which in turn hinders cell growth.\nIt achieves this by binding to a transcription factor called E2F, thus reducing gene transcription. When the Rb function is lost, it can lead to irregularities in the cell cycle, resulting in the development of cancers. The loss of Rb function can be due to chromosomal mutations that deactivate the gene or through the binding of viral onco-proteins that inactivate the Rb protein (pRb).\n\n3.2.1 Rb Gene Inactivation\nThe Rb protein is like a master organizer inside our cells. It helps put together groups of proteins that control the reading of our genetic instructions.\nBut sometimes, its groups need to be taken apart, and Rb has ways to do that. There are four known ways that Rb gets turned off, kind of like a switch, which then lets those protein groups disassemble and do their own things.\nThere are four main mechanisms covered:\n\nGenetic Mutation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Genetic Mutations\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Rb gene as a set of instructions that tells cells when to stop growing. Sometimes, mistakes, called mutations, can happen in these instructions. It’s like a typo in a recipe that changes how the dish turns out.\nThese mutations can turn off the “stop growing” signal of the Rb gene. As a result, cells might not know when to stop growing, and they could start growing too much and form a tumor. So, genetic mutations can mess up the Rb gene’s job and lead to the cells not stopping their growth properly.\nViral Inactivation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Viral Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nThink of the Rb gene as a traffic controller for cell growth. Now, imagine some tricky viruses coming along and trying to confuse this traffic controller. These viruses have special tricks that make the traffic controller (Rb protein) not work properly. It’s like they put gum on the buttons or messed up the signals. When the traffic controller can’t do its job, cells might start growing too much and create a lump called a tumor. So, just like viruses can make you feel sick, they can also make cells not stop growing when they should, because they mess with the Rb gene’s instructions.\nPhosphorylation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nThink of the Rb protein as a switch that tells cells when to stop growing. Sometimes, other molecules in the cell can add a small tag called a phosphate to this switch. It’s like putting a lock on the switch so it can’t work properly. When this happens, the switch (Rb protein) can’t do its job of stopping cell growth. The cells might then start growing and dividing more than they should, forming a lump called a tumor. So, when these tags are added to the switch, it’s like the switch gets locked and can’t control cell growth anymore.\nDegradation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Degradation\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Rb protein as a brake that stops cells from growing too much. But there’s a process where the cell can break down, or degrade, this brake. It’s like if you had a bike with a broken brake, you couldn’t slow down easily. When the Rb brake gets broken down, cells might not know when to stop growing, and they could grow too fast, forming a lump called a tumor. So, just as a broken bike brake can make riding unsafe, when the cell’s brake (Rb protein) gets broken down, it can’t control cell growth properly.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Functions of the Rb Gene\nFirst, it acts as a helper in gene activity and also as a connector between various proteins. It does this through four types of interactions with other proteins. For instance, it can team up with E2F, a gene regulator, to keep it away from its target genes. Additionally, it can join E2F right at the start point of a gene, making E2F less effective and helping to silence the gene. Sometimes, Rb interacts with other transcription factors too. Lastly, Rb can act as a connector for specific processes, like causing the degradation of SKP2 protein. SKP2 is related to cell cycle regulation.\n\n\n3.2.3 Rb and the Cell Cycle\nRb behaves differently in parts of the cell cycle:\n\nDuring the G1 Phase\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of the Rb Protein in the G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Rb protein is active, it attaches to a gene-regulating protein called E2F.\nThis attachment stops the creation of certain proteins needed for the S stage of the cell cycle. As a result, the cell cycle can’t move forward smoothly. This action of the Rb protein helps in preventing uncontrolled cell growth and acts as a safeguard against the development of tumors.\nFrom the G1 Phase to the S Phase\nMoving from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle involves certain changes. When there’s more activity of proteins called Cyclin D and Cdk4/6, they cause Rb to become hyperphosphorylated.\nThis process is like a switch that changes the state of Rb. Normally, Rb is like a tumor suppressor, but in this case, it gets turned off. This happens because it separates from E2F, a protein that usually keeps genes from getting too active. When Rb disconnects from E2F, E2F becomes able to activate gene expression, and it’s like releasing the brake on the cell cycle, allowing it to move forward.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Rb and p53 and Viral Proteins\n\n3.2.4.1 In p53\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes of p53 Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to preventing tumors, both the Tumor Suppressor Rb and p53 play important roles. For tumors to develop and for cells without Rb to survive, it’s necessary to turn off or deactivate p53. This interaction between Rb and p53 is crucial for the way tumors grow and progress.\n\n\n3.2.4.2 With Viral Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nVirally Transformed Cell with E2F\n\n\n\n\nThe Tumor Suppressor Rb interacts with viral proteins from certain DNA viruses. Examples of these viruses include papilloma virus, adenovirus, and polyoma virus. These viruses can’t replicate their DNA by themselves, so they rely on the cell’s own DNA replication machinery to do that. Interestingly, when these viruses interact with Rb, they can accidentally cause cells to transform. However, their main goal is to trigger the cell to enter the S phase of the cell cycle, which is necessary for the viruses to multiply successfully.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Identifying and Characterizing Rb Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nE2F in a Virus-Infected and an Uninfected Cell\n\n\n\n\nThe discovery and understanding of Rb in cells involved examining its interactions.\nIn cells not affected by adenovirus, a protein called E2F doesn’t connect with the E4 protein of the virus, and this keeps E2F linked to the cellular Rb proteins.\nHowever, in cells that are infected with adenovirus, a different protein, E1A, binds strongly to Rb and encourages E2F to connect with E4 from the virus.\nThis results in E2F separating from Rb. Moreover, E2F and the adenovirus E4 protein are found together in purification processes, forming a complex. This complex created by E2F and E4 connects with the promoter of a specific gene called E2.\n\n3.2.5.1 Inhibiting E2F Activity\nThe GST-fusion protein technique is used to find out how proteins interact and to pinpoint their important parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Banding in an Rb Protein Fragment\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a piece of the protein that’s made up of 29 building blocks (called amino acids) located at the end of the protein structure. This piece, specifically from position 409 to 437, has the ability to attach to Rb. Within this stretch, the smaller portion from position 409 to 426 is especially important for binding.\nThis shorter section is known as the Minimal Binding Motif, which means it’s the essential part that makes the connection happen between these proteins.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Removing Rb from E2F\nThe process of phosphorylation is what causes Rb to detach from E2F. There are various spots on the Rb protein where phosphorylation happens. Many of these phosphorylation sites are found at the ends of Rb, both at the C-terminus and N-terminus. However, there are fewer spots where phosphorylation occurs in the central “Pocket Domain” of Rb.\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to Remove Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nThe pocket regions of Rb are important because they connect with both E2F and an enzyme called Histone deacetylase (i.e., HDAC). HDAC has a role in taking away certain parts (acetyl groups) from histones, which leads to the tightening of the nucleosome core and stops the process of transcription (gene expression).\nAdditionally, when a particular loop in Rb becomes phosphorylated at positions T821 and T826, it folds back onto a specific part called the B sub-domain. In this position, it forms interactions with a group of amino acids called Lys patch, which contains six lysine residues. This arrangement is significant for how Rb works and interacts with other molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nThe process of phosphorylation starts a series of step-by-step interactions within the Rb protein. These interactions happen between the part at the end of Rb (C-Terminal region) and the central Pocket Domain. This sequence of interactions gradually weakens the connection between Rb and E2F. This process occurs as cells move through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Diagrams Showcasing How Phosphorylation Removes Rb from E2F/DP\n\n\n\n\nThe end part of Rb, called RbC, attaches to E2F only when E2F is joined with DP. When RbC gets phosphorylated, it undergoes a change in shape that prevents it from reaching a spot where E2F would normally bind. This change effectively stops the connection between RbC and E2F, altering how they interact.\nWhen Rb isn’t phosphorylated, it connects to E2F-DP combinations using three distinct interactions. The pocket part of Rb sticks to the E2F transactivation domain (E2F-TD), while the RbCnter and RbCcore parts attach to the E2FCM and DP CM domains, respectively. As the cell progresses through the early/mid G1 phase, a process known as phosphorylation happens, where Cdk4-CyclinD phosphorylates specific sites, such as Ser 788 and Ser 795. This phosphorylation causes the RbCnter to separate, decreasing the overall connection between RbC and E2FCM-DPCM.\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Progression Through Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nLater on, additional phosphorylation, specifically of Thr 821 and Thr 826, prompts an interaction within Rb itself. This interaction between RbC and the Rb pocket prevents RbCcore from binding to E2FCM-DPCM. Furthermore, phosphorylation of other sites within the pocket region is likely to disrupt the binding of the E2F transactivation domain. In essence, these phosphorylation events lead to changes in the way Rb interacts with E2F-DP complexes, affecting their overall affinity and connection."

    "section": "3.3 Cancer Cell Metabolism",
    "text": "3.3 Cancer Cell Metabolism\nOne major sign of cancer cells is that they use energy differently, which we call “altered cell metabolism” or the Warburg Effect. Unlike regular cells, cancer cells have a big change in how they process glucose, which is like their fuel.\nEven when there’s oxygen around, cancer cells tend to change glucose into something called lactate instead of using it normally. Also, these cells don’t send much of a molecule called pyruvate to a cycle that helps make energy, called the TCA cycle. This special way cancer cells handle energy sets them apart from healthy cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAltered Metabolism in a Cancer Cell\n\n\n\n\nCancer cells and tiny organisms like microbes act in similar ways when they’re in similar environments. When they don’t have a lot of nutrients, both cancer cells and microbes use oxidative metabolism. But when they’re growing quickly, they switch to a different kind of metabolism called non-oxidative metabolism. This helps them manage their energy needs depending on what’s happening around them.\n\n3.3.1 Why a Less Energy Efficient Metabolism for Cancer Cells?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Metabolism for Cancer Cells\n\n\n\n\nWhen cells are growing quickly, they have a lot of ATP and NADH, which are like energy molecules. However, when cells go through apoptosis, which is a normal process of controlled cell death, their ATP levels drop, and they switch to a different type of metabolism to handle this change. An enzyme called adenylate kinase helps convert 2 ADP molecules into ATP and AMP.\nWhen AMP levels become high, a special protein called AMPK becomes active. This process relies on another protein called tumor suppressor protein LKB1. LKB1 helps add a phosphate group to different target proteins, which leads to improvements in how cells manage energy changes. This whole system helps cells adapt to different energy levels and maintain their functions.\n\n\n3.3.2 Metabolic Needs for Cancerous Cells\nWhen cells are rapidly dividing to create new cells, they have specific energy and building block needs. To make two new cells, the dividing cell has to duplicate everything it has. This means it requires a lot of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids – these are like the building materials of the cell. Glucose, a type of sugar, is important because it can be used to create energy (ATP) as well as the needed building blocks.\nEnergy is crucial for the chemical reactions happening inside cells, and ATP is like the energy currency of the cell. However, when cells make new parts of themselves (biomass), they need extra carbon beyond just ATP. For instance, a glucose molecule can give 36 ATPs or provide six carbon atoms that are used to create fatty acids, a type of lipid. So, most of the glucose can’t be fully used for energy.\nWhen cells are actively dividing, they rely heavily on glucose and another molecule called glutamine to make the building blocks they need to create new cells and their components. Glucose provides both energy and the basic materials needed for cell growth. They turn most of the glucose and glutamine into a substance called lactate. This helps make something called NADPH, which is needed for building fatty acids – important components of cells.\nPart of the glucose gets used in a process called the TCA cycle, where it changes into citrate. However, because the ratio of ATP to ADP and NADH to NAD is high, the citrate made in the TCA cycle is sent out to the cell’s cytosol, which is like the fluid inside cells. Here, the citrate changes back into acetyl CoA, which is an energy molecule.\nGlutamine, on the other hand, directly joins the TCA cycle. It creates citrate in the cycle, which then moves out to the cytosol like before. After that, it changes into acetyl CoA too. Both glucose and glutamine play essential roles in providing the materials and energy needed for cells to grow and multiply quickly.\n\n3.3.2.1 More Requirements\nIn cancer cells, the way they get their energy and materials is different. When cells are rapidly growing, certain signals from growth factor receptors and enzymes like PI3K become active. This leads to increased glucose uptake – like the cells grabbing more energy from sugar – and the production of more transporters for glucose. There’s an enzyme called pyruvate kinase that usually helps cells break down glucose, but in cancer cells, this process is stopped, allowing pyruvate to be used for building larger parts of the cell.\nAnother player here is a protein called Myc, which influences the way cancer cells use glutamine. Glutamine helps create a molecule called NADPH that’s necessary for making fatty acids and other important things.\nCertain genes, like p53 and LKB1/AMPK, play a role in controlling cell metabolism. They slow down the process of glycolysis, which is how cells break down glucose for energy. This is important because it gives the cell more time to use glucose for other purposes.\nLastly, oncogenes (genes related to cancer) and tumor suppressor genes (genes that usually prevent cancer) also have a say in how cells handle metabolism. They help manage the different pathways cells use to get energy and materials. So, cancer cells have a complex mix of factors that influence their metabolism and energy use.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 PI3K / Akt / mTOR Pathway\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the PI3K / Akt / mTOR Pathway\n\n\n\n\nThe PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is like a big boss when it comes to controlling a specific type of energy process called aerobic glycolysis. It does this in a few ways: First, it boosts the presence of nutrient transporters on the cell surface, helping cells take in more nutrients. Then, it gets Akt, a type of protein, to increase glycolysis – the process that turns glucose into energy – and make more lactate.\nWhen this pathway is turned on, it’s like giving a green light to the creation of large parts of the cell. This means the cell starts making more of the building blocks it needs to grow and do its functions. So, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is like the chief manager of how cells produce energy and materials for growth.\n\n3.3.3.1 More About mTOR\n\n\n\n\n\nPathways With and Without Growth Factors\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a protein called mTOR that comes in two forms, and each form is part of a group of proteins called complexes. One of these complexes, called mTOR complex 1, is responsible for making cells grow and helping them take in nutrients.\nWhen a protein called Akt is active, it adds a phosphate group to another protein called Tsc2, and this makes Tsc2 less active. This less active Tsc2 is then stabilized. Another protein, called Rheb, becomes active when it’s in a certain state. This activated Rheb helps get mTOR complex 1 working. So, there’s a series of interactions and changes that control how mTOR complex 1 functions and influences cell growth and nutrient intake.\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Molecular Mechanics of PTEN Interactions\nPTEN is a special protein that was first found as a possible guardian against tumors. It’s often missing or damaged in various cancers.\n\n\n\n\n\nC2 Domain of PTEN\n\n\n\n\nOne part of PTEN, called the C2 domain, sticks to the cell’s outer layer using positive charges and specific loops. This is how it connects to the cell membrane. But some mutations in this part can weaken PTEN’s ability to prevent tumors.\nIn cancer cell metabolism, PTEN has important connections and interactions. The phosphatase part of PTEN and the C2 domain work together and attach in a way that tumorous changes can affect. These connections are essential for PTEN to do its job of stopping tumors from growing."

In this sort of mutation, an amino acid of the enzyme - Arginine 132 - gets mutated into histidine. This is called a R132H mutation.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of IDH1 with a R132H Mutation\n\n\n\n\nThis R132H mutation makes it so that part of IDH1 called ICT cannot make ionic bonds between itself and IDH1 (i.e., the enzyme itself).\n\n\n4.1.2 What Does IDH1 Do?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity of the IDH1 Enzyme\n\n\n\n\nThe normal or “wild type” form of IDH1 (or IDH2) help convert isocitrate - something made during the Krebs’ cycle - to something called alpha-ketoglutarate when it makes NADPH.\nWhen these enzymes are mutated, they take alpha-ketoglutarate and turn it into a cancer-causing agent called R-2-HG and also consume NADPH in the process. This “R-2-HG” then goes onto inhibit proteins that come from the alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenase family.\n\n\n4.1.3 A Closer Look at Mutant and Wild Type IDH1\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison Between the Wild Type and the Mutated Forms of IDH1\n\n\n\n\nWhen IDH1 is mutated, it stays closed. This helps alpha-ketoglutarate bind to it as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Comparison of IDH1’s Active Site in Wild Type and Mutated IDH1\n\n\n\n\nIf we take a closer look at the wild type IDH1’s active site (i.e., on the right), the 132nd arginine (i.e., R) residue behaves like a hinge that helps the protein to change between its active and inactive (i.e., closed) form.\nHowever, the R132H mutation makes it so that the protein wants to stay in a closed form, and this causes IDH1 to prefer binding to alpha-ketoglutarate and NADPH."

At this point, this switch is “off”.\nWhen a signalling molecule binds to the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (i.e., GCPR), this causes the GCPR to change shape and become activated.\nWhen something called GTP binds to the G protein, this causes the G protein to change shape (i.e., conformational change), and the \\(\\alpha\\) portion of the receptor disassociates from the receptor and a part of it called the \\(\\beta\\gamma\\) complex.

This phosphorylation affects other parts of the protein.\nThese phosphorylated dimers then attract other signalling proteins and form a complex.

    "text": "4.3 The Ras Superfamily\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Ras Superfamily of Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThis superfamily (i.e., really big family) of proteins has all sorts of single units of GTPases, and two proteins called Rho and Ras help relay signals from cell surface receptors by interacting with various other signalling proteins.\nThe Ras protein helps affect things like cell proliferation, differentiation, and stopping Ras interactions with TRKs.\n\n4.3.1 What is Ras?\nRas is really a family of related proteins belonging to something called the small GTPase class, which play an important role in transmitting signals within cells, a process known as cellular signal transduction. When Ras receives incoming signals and is “switched on,” it activates other proteins, ultimately triggering genes responsible for cell growth, differentiation, and survival.\nBecause of this, mutations in ras genes can lead to the production of permanently active Ras proteins, causing unintended and excessive signaling within the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals. Since these signals promote cell growth and division, this overactive Ras signaling can ultimately contribute to the development of cancer.\nIn humans, there are three Ras genes: HRas, KRas, and NRas, and they are among the most common oncogenes found in human cancer. Mutations that result in the permanent activation of Ras are present in approximately 20% to 25% of all human tumors and can be as high as 90% in specific types of cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Events in Ras Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Important Events in Ras Research\n\n\n\n\nDue to the significant role Ras plays in cancer development, researchers are exploring Ras inhibitors as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases characterized by Ras overexpression. These inhibitors aim to target and suppress the overactive Ras signaling that drives tumor growth.\n\n\n4.3.2 Activating Ras via RTKs and GEFs\n\n4.3.2.1 Evidence from the Drosophilia Eye\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Drosophilia Eye\n\n\n\n\nThe Drosophila eye is a has about approximately 800 identical units. Each of these units has its own individual lens, which serves the purpose of focusing incoming light onto eight photoreceptor cells located at its base. This intricate organization allows for efficient light capture and perception within the Drosophila eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Eye Colors in Mutant Fruit Flies\n\n\n\n\nThe photoreceptor cell called R7 is made for for detecting ultraviolet (UV) light nside a developing Drosophila eye. When this “R7” is absent, the fly loses its ability to see UV light, and this condition is referred to as Sevenless (i.e., Sev). The Sev gene encodes for an RTK, and mutations in this RTK gene block the development of R7. What’s weird is that in some flies, RTK remains functional, but R7 does not develop.\nFurther investigations into these mutants revealed that they carry mutations in the ligand of Sev, called Bride-of-sevenless (i.e., Boss), which is made by another photoreceptor cell known as R8.\nThrough genetic screening, researchers identified Ras as a component in the Sev signaling pathway. Mutations in either Sev or Ras resulted in the loss of R7. However, an important finding was that an overactive, mutated Ras could still induce the development of R7, even in the presence of mutations in Sev and Boss. This suggests that Ras acts downstream of Sev in the signaling pathway, and its activation in R7 precursor cells is both necessary and sufficient to trigger differentiate R7 photoreceptor cells.\n\n\n4.3.2.2 How Sev’s RTK Activates Ras in the Eye of a Fly\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Ras via the Rev Gene’s Encoded RTK\n\n\n\n\nThere are five steps:\n\nThe Boss protein that is carried on the surface of the R8 cell binds with Sev RTK - the RTK encoded by the Sev gene - on the R7 cell’s surface.\nThis binding then triggers a protein called Drk to activate another protein called Ras-GEF (SOS).\nThis Drk protein also recognizes a specific phosphorylated tyrosine (i.e., pY) on the Sev RTK using its SH2 domain and interacts with Ras-GEF (SOS) through two SH3 domains.\nSOS activates the Ras protein by replacing GDP with GTP (in the Ras).\nThe Ras is now ready to send off signals and set off a series of events inside the cell.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Activators of Ras\nIn mammals, RTKs can bind to Ras through an adaptor protein called Grb2, and this causes Ras to be activated.\nThough, in some cases, the GEF of Ras can be activated even without needing RTKs. For example, this GEF can be activated using Ca2+ ions and something else called diacylglycerol - these two things help G-protein-linked receptors and activate Ras\n\n\n4.3.4 Activating Ras Using a Single Molecule\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Ras Using a Single Molecule\n\n\n\n\nIn this experiment, the Ras protein is has a yellow flourescent protein (i.e., YFP) attached to it, and GTP molecules that have been attached to red flourescent proteins (i.e., RFPs). The Ras was activated by the GTPs, and the YFP that was atttached to it was also activated (i.e., it is activated at wavelengths of 476 nm and emits light at 528 nm). On the other hand, the RFP emits light at about 617 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\nFRET Plot\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from the above plot, there’s a peak at somewhere around 3 to 4 minutes and the Ras was activated at around 30 seconds.\n\n\n4.3.5 How do Ras Events Last for a Long Time?\n\n\n\n\n\nProlonging Ras Signalling Effects\n\n\n\n\nRas is inactivated when the GTP that was bound to it gets hydrolyzed or turned into GDP. In this sense, the initial signals that Ras sends out don’t last very long, but the signals that they send out do last for a long time.\nSomething called a Mitogen-Activated Protein (i.e., MAP) module can form a group or module that is used in signalling in various events. When this “module” is active, the MAP kinase module then helps out by phosphorylating other proteins (including transcription regulators and other kinases as well).\n\n\n4.3.6 Cancer-Causing Effects of Ras\nWhen the DNA from a mutated Ras gene was put into a normal cell, researchers found that piece of DNA alone was not enough to make the cell cancerous. In fact, mutated and cancer-causing (i.e., oncogenic) Ras genes stop cell proliferation and don’t promote tumor formation. Though, what is interesting is that previously mutated cells (e.g., from viral proteins, carcinogens, and their like) could be made cancerous because of the mutated Ras gene.\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Tumor-Free Mice Over Time\n\n\n\n\nIn the above graph, oncogenic DNA was introduced into mice. The mice with one or two oncogenes (i.e., cancer-causing genes) developed cancer slower. On the other hand, introducing the Myc and the Ras oncogenes into the mice more than doubled the rate at which these mice came down with tumors.\n\n\n4.3.7 Embedding Ras into the Cell Membranes\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Ras Gets Inserted into the Cell Membranes\n\n\n\n\nSomething called farnesyl pyrophosphate (i.e., the stuff in orange in the above diagram) is attached to Ras that have been newly made in the cytoplasm by an enzyme called farnesyltransferase (i.e., Ftase).\nAnother enzyme called palmitoyltransferase (i.e., PTase) then attaches something called palmitoyl to the C-ending of the Ras’ cysteine residue, and this keeps the Ras stable in the membrane.\n\n\n4.3.8 Enzymatic Activity of Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nRas Going from its Active State to its Inactive State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRas’ Enzyme Activity\n\n\n\n\nThere are four steps to this:\n\nRas takes a proton from a catalytic water molecule using its GTP molecule’s \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate\nThe above step results in a nucleophilic hydroxide ion that then attacks the GTP’s \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate.\nThis leads to the formation of an intermediate that has a sort of triangle pyramid shape.\nWhen GDP leaves in this reaction, this intermediate then decomposes down into GDP and phosphate.\n\n\n4.3.8.1 Going from GDP-Ras to GTP-Ras\nWe know that the Ras protein binds to something called the Son of Sevenless (i.e., SOS) without any nucleotides.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the Ras-SOS Complex\n\n\n\n\nThe Ras in the Ras-SOS complex is pretty much the same if you don’t mind the changes in the switches, the P-loop, and the Mg2+ binding region. However, there is a helix called “H” in the above diagram that is inserted within the Ras in the Ras-SOS complex."

This event results in the creation of a modified chromosome 22 otherwise known as the Philadelphia chromosome. Nonetheless, this event also creates an abnormally active tyrosine kinase and ultimately, cancer.\nAs cancerous cells in CML patients all have the Philadelphia chromosome, this suggests the cells are derived from an ancestor.\nRandom Inactivation of X Chromosomes\nRandom X chromosomes are inactivated during one’s lifetime. In tumor tissue, the cancerous cells have the same (in)activated X chromosomes, hinting that the cancerous cells must derived from a common ancestor."

Could the cancer have been transmitted as a result of a virus or a microorganism?\n(hint: Tasmanian devils often fight by biting their opponent’s face and mouth. One of the Tasmanian devils also has an inversion on chromosome 5 that cannot be found in its facial tumor)\n\nThe fact that the cancerous cells all share common feature hint to the clonal origin of cancer. We can deduce that the tumors all came from the same cancerous cell. A Tasmanian devil’s fighting style would likely inflict deep puncture wounds on their opponent - if the cancer were transmissible through bites (i.e., the cancerous cells could be transmitted via saliva), this could explain why the 11 Tasmanian devils karyotyped all have facial tumors with similar genetic abnormalities.\nThe cancer could have been transmitted by a microorganism, but this is unlikely. At least in the context of this course, viral proteins can cause cancer by affecting E2F and Rb’s interaction, but not in this manner."

So, there must be something in those normal cells that caused this behavior.\nWhen normal fibroblasts were fused with HeLa cells, they found that the new cells were cancerous. A closer look at those cells revealed that a missing chromosome 11 was what was causing the behavior, so this led to the hypothesis of a “stop cancer” gene on chromosome 11 - hence tumor supporessor genes."
