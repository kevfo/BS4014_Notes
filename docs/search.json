    "text": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry\nThis portion of the week’s lecture focuses on cancer origins and proto-oncogenes: genes involved in cell growth and division that could potentially be an oncogene and contribute to cancer when it’s mutated or overexpressed.\n\n1.1.1 The Cell Cycle and Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nStages of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nCells - the building blocks of living organisms - come together to form larger structures called tissues. Cells rest, grow, divide to make more cells, change into specific roles, and eventually die. It’s important for cells to follow this cycle to keep everything working smoothly.\nFurthermore, the human body has 1014 cells. Billions of cells undergo mutations each day.\nSometimes, these mutations can cause the cell to grow or divide vigorously. These are mutant cells. These mutant cells can also invade other cells if left uncontrolled.\n\n\n1.1.2 Origins of Cancer\nThis sub-subsection examines two sources of cancer.\n\n1.1.2.1 Clonal\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations Creating a Cancerouns Cell\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that cancer is not caused by a single mutation. It is the result of many mutations that accumulate over time.\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Molecular\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Mutations on a Hypothetical Gene X\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic demonstrates two main ways by which a gene “Gene X” could be inactivated, thereby causing cancer:\n\nGenetic Gene Inactivation\nIn this scenario, “Gene X” could be vital for restricting cell growth and / or division. If “Gene X” happens to be silenced or inactivated, the cell would have no way of slowing its growth or division.\nAs the cell continues to divide and grow, this may cause cancer if the cells grow uncontrollably and the silenced “Gene X” is allowed to be transmitted to daughter cells.\nDNA Packaging into Heterochromatin\nHeterochromatin is tightly packed DNA that is not very accessible for gene expression. Nonetheless, if a crucial part of DNA involved in overseeing cell growth is silenced or is not as expressed, the processes that the “part of DNA” is involved in could lead to cancer if it causes cells to grow or divide uncontrollably.\nMethylation of “C” Nucleotides\nMethyl groups can attach to the “C” nucleotides of DNA. However, when too many methyl groups attach to these “C” nucleotides, the DNA may not be transcripted properly, possibly leading to cancer as the proteins that control cell growth and division may not be expressed properly.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Molecular Events in Cancer\nWhen normal cells undergo mitosis, telomeres - the ends of the cells’ chromosomes - shorten each time a cell divides. Once the telomere is too short, the cell stops dividing for good. This entire process - in fancy speak - is called replicative cell senescence.\nCanceorus cells don’t undergo replicative cell senescence for one of two reasons:\n\nInactivation of p53 Pathway\nThe p53 pathway is akin to a security system that ensures that everything is well prior to the cell dividing. If this pathway is inactivated, cells could potentially keep dividing and cause a tumor (i.e., cancer).\nMaintaining Telomerase Activity For Too Long\nA telomerase is an enzyme that prevents telomeres from getting shorter with each cell division. When cells don’t stop dividing, this can lead to cancer.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Rb Protein in Cell Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Changes Throughout the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how behavioral changes in Retinoblastoma (i.e., Rb) - a so-called “stop sign” that controls cell division - influences the cell cycle:\n\nWhen cells are done dividing, Rb is activated by phosphatases.\nWhen mitogens - signal proteins - don’t get secreted, Rb “sticks” to other proteins that also control cell growth. This inhibits the cell from dividing as cell growth no longer works.\nWhen signals cause the cell to grow, cyclins and CDKs (i.e., Cyclin-Dependent Kinases) become active. These cyclins and CDKs put phosphate groups on Rb.\nBecause of 3., Rb and another protein called E2F cannot bind together. Certain genes that signal cells to grow become activated.\n\n\n1.1.4.1 Removing Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\nThe end part of Rb - RbC - only connects to E2F when it’s with another protein called DP. When phosphate groups are added to RbC, Rb changes its shape - this causes E2F to not attach to a specific spot on Rb.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Reaction Cycle of Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle of Ras Activation and Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nThe protein Ras in the above figure is a molecular switch that controls signalling pathways involved in growth, survival, and proliferation. The above graphic also shows how Ras behaves in a cell:\n\nGDIs - “caretakers” of Ras - form groups with Ras. These groups are soluble and enable Ras to move between various parts of the cell membrane.\nWhen the Ras has a GDP molecule attached to it, it enters a “resting” mode. A helper called GEF steps in when it’s time for Ras to become active again. GEF helps Ras exchange GDP for GTP - this gives the Ras energy to do its job.\nAt this point, Ras is capable of interacting with other proteins called effectors. These effectors enable Ras to start a chain reaction of signals.\nWhen a protein called GAP binds to Ras, GAP breaks apart Ras and the GTP molecule that it was originally bound to. This is called hydrolysis. Ras goes back to its resting state.\n\n\n1.1.5.1 Examples of Ras Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Ras Mutations and Tumor Causes\n\n\n\n\nThe above table displays some examples of Ras mutations and the kinds of tumors that they can cause.\nTwo structural mutations are covered in this week’s lecture:\n\nG12R Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12R Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nA guanidium group appears here and has new interactions - a salt bridge interaction with the \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate of GTP and the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the T35 amino acid in the figure above.\nThe sidechain of amino acid Q61 also moves away from Ras’ binding pocket, hence GTP is unable to be broken down in this mutant.\nG12V Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12V Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a big distance between the nitrogen backbone of G13 and the \\(\\beta\\)-\\(\\gamma\\) bridging oxygen of GTP.\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Inhibiting Ras Activity\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms to Inhibit Ras\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines some possible approaches to inhibit Ras activity:\n\nStabilization of GTPase-Protein Complexes\nThis refers to finding ways to keep GTPases bound to their GTP molecules for as long as possible. The longer the two entities stay together, Ras activity will not happen.\nInterference with Nucleotide Binding\nRas will be unable to switch between its active and inactivate staes as a result of this, hence downstream pathways don’t get activated.\nIrreversible Covalent Modification\nA chemical group could be attached to GTPases, thereby changing its structure and preventing proper function. If a GTPase is unable to activate Ras, then Ras activity cannot resume.\nInhibition of GTPase-GEF Interactions\nThis directly prevents Ras from being activated, essentially stopping Ras activity.\nInhibition of GTPase-Effector Interactions\nThis disrupts the communications that Ras uses to activate pathways, hence cutting off Ras activity."

    "text": "1.2 Transthyretin (i.e., TTR) Amyloidoses\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of TTR Subunits\n\n\n\n\nTTR is a blood protein that’s found in our blood in minuscule amounts (i.e., about 5 \\(\\mu\\)mol) and carries two things around in rodents: retinol and thyroxine (i.e., T4).\nTTR is about 127 amino acids long and form groups of four called tetramers. These groups carry two retinol binding proteins. When TTR is mutated, this can cause degenrative diseases.\n\n1.2.1 Alzheimer’s Disease (i.e., AD)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Healthy Brain versus a Brain with AD\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes 60% to 70% of dementia cases. 26 million patients suffer from it as of the time of writing.\nAD starts with short term memory loss before going to language problems, disorientation, and losing body functions in the long run (before the patient dies).\n\n1.2.1.1 APP Processing and AD\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Non-Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nAPP is a protein that is processed in our brains in a certain fashion:\n\nA “pair of scissors” \\(\\alpha\\)-secretase cuts APP. A secretase is a protein that cuts transmembrane proteins into smaller parts so that it can be degraded or used elsewhere.\nTwo fragments called APPs\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF are released: APPs\\(\\alpha\\) is released to the outside of the cell.\nAnother “pair of scissors” \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cuts \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF into two more parts: p3 and AICD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nWhen things go awry, \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cleaves \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF to form AICD and A\\(\\beta\\). These amyloids form fibrils that are responsible for Alzheimer’s.\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Inhibiting Amyloid Fibril Formation\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies to Inhibit Amyloid Fibril Formation\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure lists strategies to prevent amyloid fibrils from forming (hence leading to Alzheimer’s):\n\nStabilization of the Native State\nBy maintaining the original shape of p3, it won’t turn into A\\(\\beta\\) and form the said fibrils.\nSequestering Monomeric Unfolded State\nSpecial molecules could be used to keep unfolded proteins from sticking together and forming clumps (hence inhibiting fibril formation).\nStabilization or Promotion of Off-Pathway Oligomers\nSometimes, proteins can come together in a way that they’re not supposed to. These are called off-pathway oligomers and can lead to fibril formation.\n\\(\\beta\\)-Sheet Breakers that Stop Fibril Elongation\nAmyloid fibrils are linked together by structures called \\(\\beta\\)-sheets. Breaking these sheets stops amyloid fibrils from forming.\nDisassembly of Amyloid Fibrils\nDisassembling fibrils can help stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nRefolding\nWhen the proteins that form the fibrils get refolded properly, they no longer form fibrils and also don’t contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nClearance by Chaperons and Antibodies\nWhen chaperones and antibodies work together, they stop amyloid fibrils from sticking together and causing problems. This also prevents amyloid fibril formation."
