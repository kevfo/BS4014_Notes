    "section": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry",
    "text": "1.1 Cancer: Cells, Genetics, and Biochemistry\nThis portion of the week’s lecture focuses on cancer origins and proto-oncogenes: genes involved in cell growth and division that could potentially be an oncogene and contribute to cancer when it’s mutated or overexpressed.\n\n1.1.1 The Cell Cycle and Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nStages of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nCells - the building blocks of living organisms - come together to form larger structures called tissues. Cells rest, grow, divide to make more cells, change into specific roles, and eventually die. It’s important for cells to follow this cycle to keep everything working smoothly.\nFurthermore, the human body has 1014 cells. Billions of cells undergo mutations each day.\nSometimes, these mutations can cause the cell to grow or divide vigorously. These are mutant cells. These mutant cells can also invade other cells if left uncontrolled.\n\n\n1.1.2 Origins of Cancer\nThis sub-subsection examines two sources of cancer.\n\n1.1.2.1 Clonal\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations Creating a Cancerouns Cell\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that cancer is not caused by a single mutation. It is the result of many mutations that accumulate over time.\n\n\n1.1.2.2 Molecular\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Mutations on a Hypothetical Gene X\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic demonstrates two main ways by which a gene “Gene X” could be inactivated, thereby causing cancer:\n\nGenetic Gene Inactivation\nIn this scenario, “Gene X” could be vital for restricting cell growth and / or division. If “Gene X” happens to be silenced or inactivated, the cell would have no way of slowing its growth or division.\nAs the cell continues to divide and grow, this may cause cancer if the cells grow uncontrollably and the silenced “Gene X” is allowed to be transmitted to daughter cells.\nDNA Packaging into Heterochromatin\nHeterochromatin is tightly packed DNA that is not very accessible for gene expression. Nonetheless, if a crucial part of DNA involved in overseeing cell growth is silenced or is not as expressed, the processes that the “part of DNA” is involved in could lead to cancer if it causes cells to grow or divide uncontrollably.\nMethylation of “C” Nucleotides\nMethyl groups can attach to the “C” nucleotides of DNA. However, when too many methyl groups attach to these “C” nucleotides, the DNA may not be transcripted properly, possibly leading to cancer as the proteins that control cell growth and division may not be expressed properly.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Molecular Events in Cancer\nWhen normal cells undergo mitosis, telomeres - the ends of the cells’ chromosomes - shorten each time a cell divides. Once the telomere is too short, the cell stops dividing for good. This entire process - in fancy speak - is called replicative cell senescence.\nCanceorus cells don’t undergo replicative cell senescence for one of two reasons:\n\nInactivation of p53 Pathway\nThe p53 pathway is akin to a security system that ensures that everything is well prior to the cell dividing. If this pathway is inactivated, cells could potentially keep dividing and cause a tumor (i.e., cancer).\nMaintaining Telomerase Activity For Too Long\nA telomerase is an enzyme that prevents telomeres from getting shorter with each cell division. When cells don’t stop dividing, this can lead to cancer.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Rb Protein in Cell Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Changes Throughout the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines how behavioral changes in Retinoblastoma (i.e., Rb) - a so-called “stop sign” that controls cell division - influences the cell cycle:\n\nWhen cells are done dividing, Rb is activated by phosphatases.\nWhen mitogens - signal proteins - don’t get secreted, Rb “sticks” to other proteins that also control cell growth. This inhibits the cell from dividing as cell growth no longer works.\nWhen signals cause the cell to grow, cyclins and CDKs (i.e., Cyclin-Dependent Kinases) become active. These cyclins and CDKs put phosphate groups on Rb.\nBecause of 3., Rb and another protein called E2F cannot bind together. Certain genes that signal cells to grow become activated.\n\n\n1.1.4.1 Removing Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\nThe end part of Rb - RbC - only connects to E2F when it’s with another protein called DP. When phosphate groups are added to RbC, Rb changes its shape - this causes E2F to not attach to a specific spot on Rb.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Reaction Cycle of Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle of Ras Activation and Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nThe protein Ras in the above figure is a molecular switch that controls signalling pathways involved in growth, survival, and proliferation. The above graphic also shows how Ras behaves in a cell:\n\nGDIs - “caretakers” of Ras - form groups with Ras. These groups are soluble and enable Ras to move between various parts of the cell membrane.\nWhen the Ras has a GDP molecule attached to it, it enters a “resting” mode. A helper called GEF steps in when it’s time for Ras to become active again. GEF helps Ras exchange GDP for GTP - this gives the Ras energy to do its job.\nAt this point, Ras is capable of interacting with other proteins called effectors. These effectors enable Ras to start a chain reaction of signals.\nWhen a protein called GAP binds to Ras, GAP breaks apart Ras and the GTP molecule that it was originally bound to. This is called hydrolysis. Ras goes back to its resting state.\n\n\n1.1.5.1 Examples of Ras Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Ras Mutations and Tumor Causes\n\n\n\n\nThe above table displays some examples of Ras mutations and the kinds of tumors that they can cause.\nTwo structural mutations are covered in this week’s lecture:\n\nG12R Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12R Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nA guanidium group appears here and has new interactions - a salt bridge interaction with the \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate of GTP and the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the T35 amino acid in the figure above.\nThe sidechain of amino acid Q61 also moves away from Ras’ binding pocket, hence GTP is unable to be broken down in this mutant.\nG12V Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMOL Visualization of G12V Mutant of Ras\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a big distance between the nitrogen backbone of G13 and the \\(\\beta\\)-\\(\\gamma\\) bridging oxygen of GTP.\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Inhibiting Ras Activity\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms to Inhibit Ras\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines some possible approaches to inhibit Ras activity:\n\nStabilization of GTPase-Protein Complexes\nThis refers to finding ways to keep GTPases bound to their GTP molecules for as long as possible. The longer the two entities stay together, Ras activity will not happen.\nInterference with Nucleotide Binding\nRas will be unable to switch between its active and inactivate staes as a result of this, hence downstream pathways don’t get activated.\nIrreversible Covalent Modification\nA chemical group could be attached to GTPases, thereby changing its structure and preventing proper function. If a GTPase is unable to activate Ras, then Ras activity cannot resume.\nInhibition of GTPase-GEF Interactions\nThis directly prevents Ras from being activated, essentially stopping Ras activity.\nInhibition of GTPase-Effector Interactions\nThis disrupts the communications that Ras uses to activate pathways, hence cutting off Ras activity."

These groups carry two retinol binding proteins. When TTR is mutated, this can cause degenrative diseases.\n\n1.2.1 Alzheimer’s Disease (i.e., AD)\n\n\n\n\n\nA Healthy Brain versus a Brain with AD\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes 60% to 70% of dementia cases. 26 million patients suffer from it as of the time of writing.\nAD starts with short term memory loss before going to language problems, disorientation, and losing body functions in the long run (before the patient dies).\n\n1.2.1.1 APP Processing and AD\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Non-Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nAPP is a protein that is processed in our brains in a certain fashion:\n\nA “pair of scissors” \\(\\alpha\\)-secretase cuts APP. A secretase is a protein that cuts transmembrane proteins into smaller parts so that it can be degraded or used elsewhere.\nTwo fragments called APPs\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF are released: APPs\\(\\alpha\\) is released to the outside of the cell.\nAnother “pair of scissors” \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cuts \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF into two more parts: p3 and AICD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Schematic of Amyloidogenic APP Processing\n\n\n\n\nWhen things go awry, \\(\\gamma\\)-secretase cleaves \\(\\alpha\\)-CTF to form AICD and A\\(\\beta\\).

These are called off-pathway oligomers and can lead to fibril formation.\n\\(\\beta\\)-Sheet Breakers that Stop Fibril Elongation\nAmyloid fibrils are linked together by structures called \\(\\beta\\)-sheets. Breaking these sheets stops amyloid fibrils from forming.\nDisassembly of Amyloid Fibrils\nDisassembling fibrils can help stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nRefolding\nWhen the proteins that form the fibrils get refolded properly, they no longer form fibrils and also don’t contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nClearance by Chaperons and Antibodies\nWhen chaperones and antibodies work together, they stop amyloid fibrils from sticking together and causing problems. This also prevents amyloid fibril formation."

It’s like when some cells in the body start growing really fast in a weird way.

    "text": "2.2 Clonal Origins of Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor Population Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows that tumors grow over time.\nCancer usually starts from just one strange cell that’s not normal. This first weird cell forms what’s called a primary tumor. It’s like the beginning of the problem. This cell has some changes in it that it can pass down to its new cells.\nAs time goes on, more changes happen, and the tumor becomes able to invade and take over other parts. When this tumor spreads to other places, it’s called metastasized, and that’s when it’s called cancer.\n\n2.2.1 Evidence #1: Chromosomal Assembly\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in Chromosome Assembly in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n\nNormal white blood cells look a certain way in terms of their chromosomes, which are like their genetic parts. But in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (i.e., CML), there’s a special problem: a change in the chromosomes that’s unique.\nhis change is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. It happens because parts of two different chromosomes, number 9 and number 22, switch places. This helps doctors tell the difference between regular white blood cells and the ones causing CML.\n\n\n2.2.2 Evidence #2: X Chromosome Inactivation\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Mutations in Normal Adult Embryos\n\n\n\n\nIn adult bodies, one of the X chromosomes can be randomly turned off (see above) - something that happens when the person is an embryo. When scientists look at normal adult tissue, the active and the inactive X chromosome are evenly spread out.\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Mutations in Normal Adult Embryos Causing a Tumor\n\n\n\n\nWhen a tumor is present, the same inactivated chromosome is inactivated.\n\n\n2.2.3 How Cancer Develops\nCancer grows slowly as cells start to act strangely. A tumor forms as these abnormal cells keep changing and growing in number. This creates a group of really bad cells that can take over nearby tissue.\nFirst, a cell becomes mutated by accident, turning into an odd cell. Then, this cell starts to multiply, getting more mutations as it does. This keeps happening, and the cell multiplies even more, with more mutations each time. Finally, these mutated cells grow out of control and start invading nearby tissue, which can be really harmful.\nDuring a regular human life, the body goes through around 1016 cell divisions. Sometimes, mutagens - things that can cause mutations - are present in the environment. The natural rate of mutations that happen on their own is about 1 in every 10-6 genes during each cell division. This means that every gene can undergo a mutation about 1010 times.\n\n\n2.2.4 Basis for Clonal Origins of Cancer\nThere are two case studies listed here:\n\nStudy of Colon Cancer in Women in 1987 England\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Incidence over Age\n\n\n\n\nIn 1987, researchers looked at colon cancer cases in women in England. They found that as women get older, the chances of getting colon cancer increase a lot, which is shown in a graph.\nStudy of Workers Exposed to Carcinogens in 1950s\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Bladder Cancer Patients Among Workers Over Time\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above is about a group of 78 workers in a chemical industry who were exposed to a harmful substance called a carcinogen, specifically 2-naphthylamine.\nIt’s showing how long it took for these workers to develop bladder cancer after being exposed to the carcinogen. What the graph shows is that the workers who were exposed to the carcinogen for more years tended to get cancer earlier, and their cancer grew faster compared to those with less exposure."

The stroma is like a scaffold for the tumor. The cancer cells release special proteins and enzymes that cause changes in the stroma.\nThe cells in the stroma help the cancer cells grow and spread by responding to these proteins and enzymes. It’s like a conversation between the cancer cells and their surroundings that helps the cancer to grow."

    "section": "2.4 Identifying Cancer-Causing Genes",
    "text": "2.4 Identifying Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of Discovery of Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\nBack in the 1970s, people thought that cancer cells were like changed or mutant cells. This led scientists to look for genes that went through mutations while tumors were forming. But it was tough because the human genetic code was really complicated.\nCancer doesn’t usually happen because of just one change; it needs many different mutations and changes. Even now, there’s no easy way to search for genes that control cancer growth in a systematic manner. Instead, finding these important genes happened in a roundabout way, using experiments that weren’t directly focused on them.\n\n2.4.1 Mechanisms of Cancer-Causing Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nKinds of Cancer-Causing Genes and Their Mutations\n\n\n\n\nIn the above grahpic, something called an overactivity mutation can lead to cancer. In this kind of mutation, a single change happens in a gene, and it becomes an oncogene: a gene with the potential to cause cancer. This oncogene becomes more active and encourages cells to change in a way that can lead to cancer. This change is strong and directly makes cells act in a cancerous way. It’s like a dominant force that causes cancer.\nOn the other hand, something called an underactivity mutation can also lead to cancer. These mutations affect genes called tumor suppressor genes. When a first mutation happens, it doesn’t really show an effect because we usually have two copies of each gene. But if a second mutation occurs, inactivating the second copy of the gene, it can turn off the tumor-suppressing abilities of that gene. When both copies are inactive due to these mutations, it can lead to the promotion of cell changes that are linked to cancer. This type of change is recessive, and it directly causes cancer by disrupting the normal regulation of cell growth.\n\n\n2.4.2 Activating Proto-Oncogenes\n\n\n\n\n\nWays Proto-Oncogenes Can Cause Cancer\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main ways this can happen. First, the organization of these proto-oncogenes can change, making them create abnormal proteins with strange functions. Second, the control over how these genes are used can change, causing them to make too much of certain proteins that promote cell growth. These changes can make cells behave in unhealthy ways that might lead to cancer.\nA proto-oncogene can also lead to cancer in one of three ways:\n\nPoint Mutations\nA small change in the DNA can either lead to a normal amount of a hyperactive protein being produced (i.e., protein-coding mutation) or the overproduction of a normal protein.\nGene Amplification\nMistakes in the DNA produce extra copies of the gene.\nChromosomal Translation\nBreaking and rejoining DNA can produce changes in proteins. If this rejoining happens in regulatory DNA, then the normal protein can be made too much. Otherwise, a hyperactive fusion protein can be made if this happens in protein-coding DNA.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Experiments Demonstrating Proto-Oncogene Activation\nThere are three experiments mentioned:\n\n2.4.3.1 Oncogene Identification Using Mouse Fibroblast Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment Results from Murine Fibroblast Cells\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers took the DNA from normal cells and broke it into smaller pieces. Then, they put these DNA pieces into cells that were growing in a dish. The normal cells in the dish usually stop growing when they touch each other. Once they cover the dish in a single layer, they don’t keep multiplying.\nIn cells with the proto-oncogenes turned on, the researchers took the DNA from these cancerous cells and broke it into smaller pieces. They then put these DNA pieces into cells growing in a dish. The cells with the cancer-causing genes didn’t pay attention to the usual growth restraints. Instead, they started growing in an abnormal way, piling up on each other. Each pile, called a colony, came from just one starting cell. This shows how these genes can make cells act in a cancerous manner.\n\n\n2.4.3.2 Amplification of the N-myc Proto-Oncogene\n\n\n\n\n\nAmplification of the N-myc Gene\n\n\n\n\nScientists sometimes study chromosomes using two methods:\n\nG-banding\nCertain parts of the DNA get stained more or less. The staining helps identify regions with different DNA content.\nR-banding\nDifferent parts of the DNA are stained more.\n\nWhen certain regions are overactive and have a lot of DNA, they’re called Homogeneously Staining Regions (i.e., HSRs). These HSRs can sometimes be removed and become Double Minutes (i.e., DMs), which can even move to other chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of Cancers Associated with Gene Amplification\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of genes that can be overly active due to these changes are c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc.\n\n\n2.4.3.3 Chromosomal Translations\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Chromosomal Translocations\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic mentions two kinds of translocations:\n\nReciprocal Translocation\nTwo different parts of two different chromosomes are exchanged.\nRobertsonian (i.e., non-reciprocal) Translocation\nAn entire chromosome is attached to another at the centromere: the center of the chromosome.\n\n\n2.4.3.3.1 Example 1: Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (Philadelphia Chromosome)\n\n\n\n\n\nChromosomal Translocation in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n\nUsually, there are two genes named abl and bcr, and they’re on different chromosomes (chromosome 9 and 22). But sometimes, things change. The chromosomes break and swap places in a process via Robertsonian translocation. This makes the abl gene and the bcr gene stick together on one chromosome. This special chromosome is called the Philadelphia chromosome.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison Between Normal Chromosomes and Philadelphia Chromosomes\n\n\n\n\nThe breakpoint cluster region protein (i.e., bcr) is also known by another name - renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-26.\nThere’s a proto-oncogene called c-abl on chromosome 9. In certain cases, this gene moves to a specific spot called the breakpoint cluster region (i.e., bcr) on chromosome 22. When this happens, something special takes place. A new kind of tyrosine kinase forms, which works on its own without following the usual rules. This change is a bit like a switch getting flipped, and it’s part of why things go wrong in cancer.\n\n\n2.4.3.3.2 Example 2: Burkitt’s lymphoma - High-Grade B-Lymphocyte Neoplasm\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Diagrams of Burkitt’s Lymphoma\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a gene called c-myc, and it’s usually quiet in certain blood cells. But sometimes, things get mixed up. There’s a kind of change called T(8;14) translocation, and it makes c-myc wake up when it shouldn’t. This happens because c-myc moves closer to a signal that tells it to start working.\nIt’s like a switch turning on that gene all the time, and this makes the cell keep making a protein called c-myc. It’s not how it’s supposed to be, but because of this change, the cell acts differently."

These machines have a built-in safety feature” that keeps them from working all the time.\nThat said, there’s a phosphate group that, when removed, makes the kinase’s structure more flexible. Another part, like a button, gets pressed when an activating signal attaches to it. This signal binds to the protein in a special spot called the SH3 domain.\nNow, because of this signal, the protein becomes a kinase, a part that can activate other parts. It’s like a switch turning on. With this newfound power, the protein can do something called phosphorylation, which is like adding a tiny tag to another part of the protein. This helps it become active and ready to do its job.\n\n2.5.1 Domains of p210 Abl-Bcr Fusion Protein\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Portions of the p210 Abl-Bcr Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things to note about this protein:\n\nBCR Portion\nThis part also has a special spot called tyrosine 177 that acts like a hook for another protein called Grb-2. It’s like they link up. This protein also knows how to do something called phosphorylation, which is like putting little tags on other parts of the protein.\nThis protein has a part that’s like a switch for another type of activity called a kinase. Imagine it’s like a control button. And there’s one more part that’s like a tool. This tool helps the protein communicate and send signals, sort of like sending messages. All these parts together make the protein work in a special way.\nABL Portion\nThis part of the protein is like a team of different parts that work together. Imagine it’s like a superhero team. Some parts are like special detectors, called SH3 and SH2, that help the protein know when things are happening around it.\nThere’s also a part called SH1, which is like the captain of the team. It’s good at changing things, kind of like a leader. Then there’s another part that helps the protein find its way to the nucleus, which is like the command center of the cell. It’s like a secret key that helps the protein go where it’s needed.\nFinally, this protein has parts that are like tools. These tools let the protein grab onto DNA and actin, which are like the building blocks and support beams of the cell. All these parts team up to make the protein do important jobs in the cell.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Abl-Bcr Protein Signalling in Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the Abl-Bcr Protein Causes CML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Discovery of Tumor Suppressor Genes\nScientists initially thought that when a gene changes, it adds new information instead of taking information away.\nHowever, two approaches outlined by Henry Harris and George Klein showed otherwise:\n\nApproach #1\nScientists did an experiment with mice cells. They mixed cells that cause cancer with cells that don’t. The new cells they got made fewer tumors than the cancer cells alone. Regular cells have genes that stop cancer-like behavior. The scientists thought that cancer might happen when certain genes are missing, not when new genes appear.\nApproach #2\nWhen two types of cells were combined, they noticed that the new cells started acting like cancer cells. They mixed normal fibroblasts with HeLa cells, which are from cervical cancer. What’s interesting is that when these new cells turned cancerous, it was linked to a missing chromosome 11. When they put back the missing part using cells from normal tissue, the cancer behavior stopped. This suggests that there might be a “stop-cancer” gene on chromosome 11. So, the loss of this gene might be causing the cancer-like behavior by removing something important.\n\nSo, the conclusion was that tumor-suppressor genes cause genetic information to be loss, not gained.\n\n\n2.5.4 Functions of Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal versus Mutated Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\nGenes that can stop tumors from growing by comparing normal cells and cancer cells. These genes have different jobs.\nSome are like “gatekeepers” that stop cells from growing too much or make them die if they’re damaged. Others are like “caretakers” that fix DNA when it’s broken.\nThese genes tell cells to make proteins that slow down how much they grow and divide. So, a bunch of these genes working together in normal cells make sure cells don’t go crazy. But if one of these genes is changed by a mutation, it can’t control the cell anymore, and it grows and divides a lot. This can lead to cancer.\n\n\n2.5.5 Inactivating Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Events that Inactivate Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding genetic events, there are also three other ways that this can happen:\n\nRecessive Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nTumor Suppressor Genes Being Inactivated\n\n\n\n\nIf only one gene is lost, the cell keeps working fine. But for cancer to happen, both sets of genes from our parents must change. This happens through different changes in the genes and how they’re used. It’s like a two-step process where changes in the genes and how they work lead to the loss of tumor suppressor gene function in cancer cells.\nPutative and Cloned Tumor Suppressor Genes\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Locations and Cancers Caused by Gene Mutations\n\n\n\n\n“Putative and Cloned Tumor Suppressor Genes” means scientists have found some genes that might stop cancer and they’ve also identified some genes that definitely do.\nImagine these genes as “superheroes” that try to prevent cells from turning into cancer. The “putative” genes are like potential heroes that scientists think might help, but they’re still checking if they’re the real deal.\nOn the other hand, the “cloned” genes are the confirmed heroes. Scientists have shown that these genes really can stop cells from going cancerous. So, it’s like scientists are assembling a team of gene superheroes to fight against cancer, with some in the “might-be” stage and others already in action.\nIntra-Cellular Localization of Tumor Suppressor Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nGene Locations and Cancers Caused by Gene Mutations\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic mentions numerous proteins that can all keep tumor suppressor genes in the same area (i.e., localization):\n\nCell Surface and Cell Matrix Molecules: NF2, APC, and DCC\nThese are genes that help prevent cells from becoming cancerous. When these genes don’t work properly, they can’t stop cells from growing uncontrollably, which can lead to tumors forming.\nNormally, cells “listen” to their neighbors and know when to stop growing. But in cancer, this communication can break down, and cells might grow without any brakes.\nSignal Transduction: NF1 and GAP\nThis point is talking about how cells communicate within themselves. The Neurofibromatosis1 (i.e., NF1) protein helps control this communication, especially with a protein called Ras. When NF1 doesn’t work right, it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.\nTranscription Regulation: Rb and p53\nCells have a guardian called p53 that monitors their DNA. If it finds damaged DNA, it can order the cell to self-destruct (apoptosis) to prevent problems from spreading. Moreover, cells have “traffic lights” called Rb proteins that tell them when to stop growing. In cancer, these “lights” might not work properly, so cells keep growing when they shouldn’t.\n\n\nAll of the mentioned proteins are crucial to proper functioning of the cell. If these proteins aren’t where they should be or if they don’t work as they should, cells can start growing uncontrollably, leading to the development of tumors and cancer."

It forms quickly in the immature cells of the retina, which is the part of the eye responsible for detecting light.\nThis cancer is quite rare, occurring in about 1 child out of every 20,000 children. It’s the most common malignant eye cancer found in kids. Interestingly, almost half of the children with retinoblastoma have a genetic mutation on chromosome 13 (gene 13q14) that is present from birth.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Retinoblastoma can be Inherited\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure outlines two ways that a child can get retinoblastoma:\n\nHereditary\nThis means that the gene changes that lead to retinoblastoma are passed down in the family. When someone has hereditary retinoblastoma, they are born with a gene change that makes them more likely to develop this type of eye cancer. This gene change can be found in every cell of their body. Because of this, both eyes are often at risk of getting cancer. People with hereditary retinoblastoma have a higher chance of developing the cancer at a younger age, and they might have other family members who also had this type of cancer.\nNon-hereditary\nThe gene changes that cause the cancer happen by chance and are not passed down from parents. These changes occur in the early stages of a person’s life, often in just one eye.\nUnlike hereditary retinoblastoma, only one eye is usually affected. People with non-hereditary retinoblastoma don’t have the same high risk of developing the cancer in both eyes, and they are less likely to have family members with the same type of cancer.\n\nIf a cell inactivates a copy of its retinoblastoma genes (i.e., Rb genes), then all’s still good as there’s a backup copy."

    "section": "3.2 The Rb Gene",
    "text": "3.2 The Rb Gene\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Roles of Rb Gene Inactivation in Various Cancers\n\n\n\n\nThe Retinoblastoma (i.e., Rb) gene acts as a vital tumor suppressor, particularly in cases of retinoblastoma, a type of retina cancer. This gene was the first identified phenotypic tumor suppressor.\nIts role is crucial in controlling the cell cycle and the advancement of tumors. It holds a significant position in the cell cycle by stopping the transition from G1 to S phase, which in turn hinders cell growth.\nIt achieves this by binding to a transcription factor called E2F, thus reducing gene transcription. When the Rb function is lost, it can lead to irregularities in the cell cycle, resulting in the development of cancers. The loss of Rb function can be due to chromosomal mutations that deactivate the gene or through the binding of viral onco-proteins that inactivate the Rb protein (pRb).\n\n3.2.1 Rb Gene Inactivation\nThe Rb protein is like a master organizer inside our cells. It helps put together groups of proteins that control the reading of our genetic instructions.\nBut sometimes, its groups need to be taken apart, and Rb has ways to do that. There are four known ways that Rb gets turned off, kind of like a switch, which then lets those protein groups disassemble and do their own things.\nThere are four main mechanisms covered:\n\nGenetic Mutation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Genetic Mutations\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Rb gene as a set of instructions that tells cells when to stop growing. Sometimes, mistakes, called mutations, can happen in these instructions. It’s like a typo in a recipe that changes how the dish turns out.\nThese mutations can turn off the “stop growing” signal of the Rb gene. As a result, cells might not know when to stop growing, and they could start growing too much and form a tumor. So, genetic mutations can mess up the Rb gene’s job and lead to the cells not stopping their growth properly.\nViral Inactivation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Viral Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nThink of the Rb gene as a traffic controller for cell growth. Now, imagine some tricky viruses coming along and trying to confuse this traffic controller. These viruses have special tricks that make the traffic controller (Rb protein) not work properly. It’s like they put gum on the buttons or messed up the signals. When the traffic controller can’t do its job, cells might start growing too much and create a lump called a tumor. So, just like viruses can make you feel sick, they can also make cells not stop growing when they should, because they mess with the Rb gene’s instructions.\nPhosphorylation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nThink of the Rb protein as a switch that tells cells when to stop growing. Sometimes, other molecules in the cell can add a small tag called a phosphate to this switch. It’s like putting a lock on the switch so it can’t work properly. When this happens, the switch (Rb protein) can’t do its job of stopping cell growth. The cells might then start growing and dividing more than they should, forming a lump called a tumor. So, when these tags are added to the switch, it’s like the switch gets locked and can’t control cell growth anymore.\nDegradation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisassembly of the Rb Protein Complex via Degradation\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Rb protein as a brake that stops cells from growing too much. But there’s a process where the cell can break down, or degrade, this brake. It’s like if you had a bike with a broken brake, you couldn’t slow down easily. When the Rb brake gets broken down, cells might not know when to stop growing, and they could grow too fast, forming a lump called a tumor. So, just as a broken bike brake can make riding unsafe, when the cell’s brake (Rb protein) gets broken down, it can’t control cell growth properly.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Functions of the Rb Gene\nFirst, it acts as a helper in gene activity and also as a connector between various proteins. It does this through four types of interactions with other proteins. For instance, it can team up with E2F, a gene regulator, to keep it away from its target genes. Additionally, it can join E2F right at the start point of a gene, making E2F less effective and helping to silence the gene. Sometimes, Rb interacts with other transcription factors too. Lastly, Rb can act as a connector for specific processes, like causing the degradation of SKP2 protein. SKP2 is related to cell cycle regulation.\n\n\n3.2.3 Rb and the Cell Cycle\nRb behaves differently in parts of the cell cycle:\n\nDuring the G1 Phase\n\n\n\n\n\nRole of the Rb Protein in the G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Rb protein is active, it attaches to a gene-regulating protein called E2F.\nThis attachment stops the creation of certain proteins needed for the S stage of the cell cycle. As a result, the cell cycle can’t move forward smoothly. This action of the Rb protein helps in preventing uncontrolled cell growth and acts as a safeguard against the development of tumors.\nFrom the G1 Phase to the S Phase\nMoving from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle involves certain changes. When there’s more activity of proteins called Cyclin D and Cdk4/6, they cause Rb to become hyperphosphorylated.\nThis process is like a switch that changes the state of Rb. Normally, Rb is like a tumor suppressor, but in this case, it gets turned off. This happens because it separates from E2F, a protein that usually keeps genes from getting too active. When Rb disconnects from E2F, E2F becomes able to activate gene expression, and it’s like releasing the brake on the cell cycle, allowing it to move forward.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Rb and p53 and Viral Proteins\n\n3.2.4.1 In p53\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes of p53 Inactivation\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to preventing tumors, both the Tumor Suppressor Rb and p53 play important roles. For tumors to develop and for cells without Rb to survive, it’s necessary to turn off or deactivate p53. This interaction between Rb and p53 is crucial for the way tumors grow and progress.\n\n\n3.2.4.2 With Viral Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nVirally Transformed Cell with E2F\n\n\n\n\nThe Tumor Suppressor Rb interacts with viral proteins from certain DNA viruses. Examples of these viruses include papilloma virus, adenovirus, and polyoma virus. These viruses can’t replicate their DNA by themselves, so they rely on the cell’s own DNA replication machinery to do that. Interestingly, when these viruses interact with Rb, they can accidentally cause cells to transform. However, their main goal is to trigger the cell to enter the S phase of the cell cycle, which is necessary for the viruses to multiply successfully.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Identifying and Characterizing Rb Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nE2F in a Virus-Infected and an Uninfected Cell\n\n\n\n\nThe discovery and understanding of Rb in cells involved examining its interactions.\nIn cells not affected by adenovirus, a protein called E2F doesn’t connect with the E4 protein of the virus, and this keeps E2F linked to the cellular Rb proteins.\nHowever, in cells that are infected with adenovirus, a different protein, E1A, binds strongly to Rb and encourages E2F to connect with E4 from the virus.\nThis results in E2F separating from Rb. Moreover, E2F and the adenovirus E4 protein are found together in purification processes, forming a complex. This complex created by E2F and E4 connects with the promoter of a specific gene called E2.\n\n3.2.5.1 Inhibiting E2F Activity\nThe GST-fusion protein technique is used to find out how proteins interact and to pinpoint their important parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Banding in an Rb Protein Fragment\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a piece of the protein that’s made up of 29 building blocks (called amino acids) located at the end of the protein structure. This piece, specifically from position 409 to 437, has the ability to attach to Rb. Within this stretch, the smaller portion from position 409 to 426 is especially important for binding.\nThis shorter section is known as the Minimal Binding Motif, which means it’s the essential part that makes the connection happen between these proteins.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Removing Rb from E2F\nThe process of phosphorylation is what causes Rb to detach from E2F. There are various spots on the Rb protein where phosphorylation happens. Many of these phosphorylation sites are found at the ends of Rb, both at the C-terminus and N-terminus. However, there are fewer spots where phosphorylation occurs in the central “Pocket Domain” of Rb.\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to Remove Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nThe pocket regions of Rb are important because they connect with both E2F and an enzyme called Histone deacetylase (i.e., HDAC). HDAC has a role in taking away certain parts (acetyl groups) from histones, which leads to the tightening of the nucleosome core and stops the process of transcription (gene expression).\nAdditionally, when a particular loop in Rb becomes phosphorylated at positions T821 and T826, it folds back onto a specific part called the B sub-domain. In this position, it forms interactions with a group of amino acids called Lys patch, which contains six lysine residues. This arrangement is significant for how Rb works and interacts with other molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Rb from E2F via Phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nThe process of phosphorylation starts a series of step-by-step interactions within the Rb protein. These interactions happen between the part at the end of Rb (C-Terminal region) and the central Pocket Domain. This sequence of interactions gradually weakens the connection between Rb and E2F. This process occurs as cells move through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Diagrams Showcasing How Phosphorylation Removes Rb from E2F/DP\n\n\n\n\nThe end part of Rb, called RbC, attaches to E2F only when E2F is joined with DP. When RbC gets phosphorylated, it undergoes a change in shape that prevents it from reaching a spot where E2F would normally bind. This change effectively stops the connection between RbC and E2F, altering how they interact.\nWhen Rb isn’t phosphorylated, it connects to E2F-DP combinations using three distinct interactions. The pocket part of Rb sticks to the E2F transactivation domain (E2F-TD), while the RbCnter and RbCcore parts attach to the E2FCM and DP CM domains, respectively. As the cell progresses through the early/mid G1 phase, a process known as phosphorylation happens, where Cdk4-CyclinD phosphorylates specific sites, such as Ser 788 and Ser 795. This phosphorylation causes the RbCnter to separate, decreasing the overall connection between RbC and E2FCM-DPCM.\n\n\n\n\n\nRb Progression Through Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\nLater on, additional phosphorylation, specifically of Thr 821 and Thr 826, prompts an interaction within Rb itself. This interaction between RbC and the Rb pocket prevents RbCcore from binding to E2FCM-DPCM. Furthermore, phosphorylation of other sites within the pocket region is likely to disrupt the binding of the E2F transactivation domain. In essence, these phosphorylation events lead to changes in the way Rb interacts with E2F-DP complexes, affecting their overall affinity and connection."

    "section": "3.3 Cancer Cell Metabolism",
    "text": "3.3 Cancer Cell Metabolism\nOne major sign of cancer cells is that they use energy differently, which we call “altered cell metabolism” or the Warburg Effect. Unlike regular cells, cancer cells have a big change in how they process glucose, which is like their fuel.\nEven when there’s oxygen around, cancer cells tend to change glucose into something called lactate instead of using it normally. Also, these cells don’t send much of a molecule called pyruvate to a cycle that helps make energy, called the TCA cycle. This special way cancer cells handle energy sets them apart from healthy cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAltered Metabolism in a Cancer Cell\n\n\n\n\nCancer cells and tiny organisms like microbes act in similar ways when they’re in similar environments. When they don’t have a lot of nutrients, both cancer cells and microbes use oxidative metabolism. But when they’re growing quickly, they switch to a different kind of metabolism called non-oxidative metabolism. This helps them manage their energy needs depending on what’s happening around them.\n\n3.3.1 Why a Less Energy Efficient Metabolism for Cancer Cells?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Metabolism for Cancer Cells\n\n\n\n\nWhen cells are growing quickly, they have a lot of ATP and NADH, which are like energy molecules. However, when cells go through apoptosis, which is a normal process of controlled cell death, their ATP levels drop, and they switch to a different type of metabolism to handle this change. An enzyme called adenylate kinase helps convert 2 ADP molecules into ATP and AMP.\nWhen AMP levels become high, a special protein called AMPK becomes active. This process relies on another protein called tumor suppressor protein LKB1. LKB1 helps add a phosphate group to different target proteins, which leads to improvements in how cells manage energy changes. This whole system helps cells adapt to different energy levels and maintain their functions.\n\n\n3.3.2 Metabolic Needs for Cancerous Cells\nWhen cells are rapidly dividing to create new cells, they have specific energy and building block needs. To make two new cells, the dividing cell has to duplicate everything it has. This means it requires a lot of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids – these are like the building materials of the cell. Glucose, a type of sugar, is important because it can be used to create energy (ATP) as well as the needed building blocks.\nEnergy is crucial for the chemical reactions happening inside cells, and ATP is like the energy currency of the cell. However, when cells make new parts of themselves (biomass), they need extra carbon beyond just ATP. For instance, a glucose molecule can give 36 ATPs or provide six carbon atoms that are used to create fatty acids, a type of lipid. So, most of the glucose can’t be fully used for energy.\nWhen cells are actively dividing, they rely heavily on glucose and another molecule called glutamine to make the building blocks they need to create new cells and their components. Glucose provides both energy and the basic materials needed for cell growth. They turn most of the glucose and glutamine into a substance called lactate. This helps make something called NADPH, which is needed for building fatty acids – important components of cells.\nPart of the glucose gets used in a process called the TCA cycle, where it changes into citrate. However, because the ratio of ATP to ADP and NADH to NAD is high, the citrate made in the TCA cycle is sent out to the cell’s cytosol, which is like the fluid inside cells. Here, the citrate changes back into acetyl CoA, which is an energy molecule.\nGlutamine, on the other hand, directly joins the TCA cycle. It creates citrate in the cycle, which then moves out to the cytosol like before. After that, it changes into acetyl CoA too. Both glucose and glutamine play essential roles in providing the materials and energy needed for cells to grow and multiply quickly.\n\n3.3.2.1 More Requirements\nIn cancer cells, the way they get their energy and materials is different. When cells are rapidly growing, certain signals from growth factor receptors and enzymes like PI3K become active. This leads to increased glucose uptake – like the cells grabbing more energy from sugar – and the production of more transporters for glucose. There’s an enzyme called pyruvate kinase that usually helps cells break down glucose, but in cancer cells, this process is stopped, allowing pyruvate to be used for building larger parts of the cell.\nAnother player here is a protein called Myc, which influences the way cancer cells use glutamine. Glutamine helps create a molecule called NADPH that’s necessary for making fatty acids and other important things.\nCertain genes, like p53 and LKB1/AMPK, play a role in controlling cell metabolism. They slow down the process of glycolysis, which is how cells break down glucose for energy. This is important because it gives the cell more time to use glucose for other purposes.\nLastly, oncogenes (genes related to cancer) and tumor suppressor genes (genes that usually prevent cancer) also have a say in how cells handle metabolism. They help manage the different pathways cells use to get energy and materials. So, cancer cells have a complex mix of factors that influence their metabolism and energy use.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 PI3K / Akt / mTOR Pathway\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the PI3K / Akt / mTOR Pathway\n\n\n\n\nThe PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is like a big boss when it comes to controlling a specific type of energy process called aerobic glycolysis. It does this in a few ways: First, it boosts the presence of nutrient transporters on the cell surface, helping cells take in more nutrients. Then, it gets Akt, a type of protein, to increase glycolysis – the process that turns glucose into energy – and make more lactate.\nWhen this pathway is turned on, it’s like giving a green light to the creation of large parts of the cell. This means the cell starts making more of the building blocks it needs to grow and do its functions. So, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is like the chief manager of how cells produce energy and materials for growth.\n\n3.3.3.1 More About mTOR\n\n\n\n\n\nPathways With and Without Growth Factors\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a protein called mTOR that comes in two forms, and each form is part of a group of proteins called complexes. One of these complexes, called mTOR complex 1, is responsible for making cells grow and helping them take in nutrients.\nWhen a protein called Akt is active, it adds a phosphate group to another protein called Tsc2, and this makes Tsc2 less active. This less active Tsc2 is then stabilized. Another protein, called Rheb, becomes active when it’s in a certain state. This activated Rheb helps get mTOR complex 1 working. So, there’s a series of interactions and changes that control how mTOR complex 1 functions and influences cell growth and nutrient intake.\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Molecular Mechanics of PTEN Interactions\nPTEN is a special protein that was first found as a possible guardian against tumors. It’s often missing or damaged in various cancers.\n\n\n\n\n\nC2 Domain of PTEN\n\n\n\n\nOne part of PTEN, called the C2 domain, sticks to the cell’s outer layer using positive charges and specific loops. This is how it connects to the cell membrane. But some mutations in this part can weaken PTEN’s ability to prevent tumors.\nIn cancer cell metabolism, PTEN has important connections and interactions. The phosphatase part of PTEN and the C2 domain work together and attach in a way that tumorous changes can affect. These connections are essential for PTEN to do its job of stopping tumors from growing."

In this sort of mutation, an amino acid of the enzyme - Arginine 132 - gets mutated into histidine. This is called a R132H mutation.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of IDH1 with a R132H Mutation\n\n\n\n\nThis R132H mutation makes it so that part of IDH1 called ICT cannot make ionic bonds between itself and IDH1 (i.e., the enzyme itself).\n\n\n4.1.2 What Does IDH1 Do?\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity of the IDH1 Enzyme\n\n\n\n\nThe normal or “wild type” form of IDH1 (or IDH2) help convert isocitrate - something made during the Krebs’ cycle - to something called alpha-ketoglutarate when it makes NADPH.\nWhen these enzymes are mutated, they take alpha-ketoglutarate and turn it into a cancer-causing agent called R-2-HG and also consume NADPH in the process. This “R-2-HG” then goes onto inhibit proteins that come from the alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenase family.\n\n\n4.1.3 A Closer Look at Mutant and Wild Type IDH1\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison Between the Wild Type and the Mutated Forms of IDH1\n\n\n\n\nWhen IDH1 is mutated, it stays closed. This helps alpha-ketoglutarate bind to it as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Comparison of IDH1’s Active Site in Wild Type and Mutated IDH1\n\n\n\n\nIf we take a closer look at the wild type IDH1’s active site (i.e., on the right), the 132nd arginine (i.e., R) residue behaves like a hinge that helps the protein to change between its active and inactive (i.e., closed) form.\nHowever, the R132H mutation makes it so that the protein wants to stay in a closed form, and this causes IDH1 to prefer binding to alpha-ketoglutarate and NADPH."

At this point, this switch is “off”.\nWhen a signalling molecule binds to the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (i.e., GCPR), this causes the GCPR to change shape and become activated.\nWhen something called GTP binds to the G protein, this causes the G protein to change shape (i.e., conformational change), and the \\(\\alpha\\) portion of the receptor disassociates from the receptor and a part of it called the \\(\\beta\\gamma\\) complex.

This phosphorylation affects other parts of the protein.\nThese phosphorylated dimers then attract other signalling proteins and form a complex.

    "text": "4.3 The Ras Superfamily\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Ras Superfamily of Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThis superfamily (i.e., really big family) of proteins has all sorts of single units of GTPases, and two proteins called Rho and Ras help relay signals from cell surface receptors by interacting with various other signalling proteins.\nThe Ras protein helps affect things like cell proliferation, differentiation, and stopping Ras interactions with TRKs.\n\n4.3.1 What is Ras?\nRas is really a family of related proteins belonging to something called the small GTPase class, which play an important role in transmitting signals within cells, a process known as cellular signal transduction. When Ras receives incoming signals and is “switched on,” it activates other proteins, ultimately triggering genes responsible for cell growth, differentiation, and survival.\nBecause of this, mutations in ras genes can lead to the production of permanently active Ras proteins, causing unintended and excessive signaling within the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals. Since these signals promote cell growth and division, this overactive Ras signaling can ultimately contribute to the development of cancer.\nIn humans, there are three Ras genes: HRas, KRas, and NRas, and they are among the most common oncogenes found in human cancer. Mutations that result in the permanent activation of Ras are present in approximately 20% to 25% of all human tumors and can be as high as 90% in specific types of cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Events in Ras Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Important Events in Ras Research\n\n\n\n\nDue to the significant role Ras plays in cancer development, researchers are exploring Ras inhibitors as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases characterized by Ras overexpression. These inhibitors aim to target and suppress the overactive Ras signaling that drives tumor growth.\n\n\n4.3.2 Activating Ras via RTKs and GEFs\n\n4.3.2.1 Evidence from the Drosophilia Eye\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Drosophilia Eye\n\n\n\n\nThe Drosophila eye is a has about approximately 800 identical units. Each of these units has its own individual lens, which serves the purpose of focusing incoming light onto eight photoreceptor cells located at its base. This intricate organization allows for efficient light capture and perception within the Drosophila eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Eye Colors in Mutant Fruit Flies\n\n\n\n\nThe photoreceptor cell called R7 is made for for detecting ultraviolet (UV) light nside a developing Drosophila eye. When this “R7” is absent, the fly loses its ability to see UV light, and this condition is referred to as Sevenless (i.e., Sev). The Sev gene encodes for an RTK, and mutations in this RTK gene block the development of R7. What’s weird is that in some flies, RTK remains functional, but R7 does not develop.\nFurther investigations into these mutants revealed that they carry mutations in the ligand of Sev, called Bride-of-sevenless (i.e., Boss), which is made by another photoreceptor cell known as R8.\nThrough genetic screening, researchers identified Ras as a component in the Sev signaling pathway. Mutations in either Sev or Ras resulted in the loss of R7. However, an important finding was that an overactive, mutated Ras could still induce the development of R7, even in the presence of mutations in Sev and Boss. This suggests that Ras acts downstream of Sev in the signaling pathway, and its activation in R7 precursor cells is both necessary and sufficient to trigger differentiate R7 photoreceptor cells.\n\n\n4.3.2.2 How Sev’s RTK Activates Ras in the Eye of a Fly\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Ras via the Rev Gene’s Encoded RTK\n\n\n\n\nThere are five steps:\n\nThe Boss protein that is carried on the surface of the R8 cell binds with Sev RTK - the RTK encoded by the Sev gene - on the R7 cell’s surface.\nThis binding then triggers a protein called Drk to activate another protein called Ras-GEF (SOS).\nThis Drk protein also recognizes a specific phosphorylated tyrosine (i.e., pY) on the Sev RTK using its SH2 domain and interacts with Ras-GEF (SOS) through two SH3 domains.\nSOS activates the Ras protein by replacing GDP with GTP (in the Ras).\nThe Ras is now ready to send off signals and set off a series of events inside the cell.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Activators of Ras\nIn mammals, RTKs can bind to Ras through an adaptor protein called Grb2, and this causes Ras to be activated.\nThough, in some cases, the GEF of Ras can be activated even without needing RTKs. For example, this GEF can be activated using Ca2+ ions and something else called diacylglycerol - these two things help G-protein-linked receptors and activate Ras\n\n\n4.3.4 Activating Ras Using a Single Molecule\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Ras Using a Single Molecule\n\n\n\n\nIn this experiment, the Ras protein is has a yellow flourescent protein (i.e., YFP) attached to it, and GTP molecules that have been attached to red flourescent proteins (i.e., RFPs). The Ras was activated by the GTPs, and the YFP that was atttached to it was also activated (i.e., it is activated at wavelengths of 476 nm and emits light at 528 nm). On the other hand, the RFP emits light at about 617 nm.\n\n\n\n\n\nFRET Plot\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from the above plot, there’s a peak at somewhere around 3 to 4 minutes and the Ras was activated at around 30 seconds.\n\n\n4.3.5 How do Ras Events Last for a Long Time?\n\n\n\n\n\nProlonging Ras Signalling Effects\n\n\n\n\nRas is inactivated when the GTP that was bound to it gets hydrolyzed or turned into GDP. In this sense, the initial signals that Ras sends out don’t last very long, but the signals that they send out do last for a long time.\nSomething called a Mitogen-Activated Protein (i.e., MAP) module can form a group or module that is used in signalling in various events. When this “module” is active, the MAP kinase module then helps out by phosphorylating other proteins (including transcription regulators and other kinases as well).\n\n\n4.3.6 Cancer-Causing Effects of Ras\nWhen the DNA from a mutated Ras gene was put into a normal cell, researchers found that piece of DNA alone was not enough to make the cell cancerous. In fact, mutated and cancer-causing (i.e., oncogenic) Ras genes stop cell proliferation and don’t promote tumor formation. Though, what is interesting is that previously mutated cells (e.g., from viral proteins, carcinogens, and their like) could be made cancerous because of the mutated Ras gene.\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Tumor-Free Mice Over Time\n\n\n\n\nIn the above graph, oncogenic DNA was introduced into mice. The mice with one or two oncogenes (i.e., cancer-causing genes) developed cancer slower. On the other hand, introducing the Myc and the Ras oncogenes into the mice more than doubled the rate at which these mice came down with tumors.\n\n\n4.3.7 Embedding Ras into the Cell Membranes\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Ras Gets Inserted into the Cell Membranes\n\n\n\n\nSomething called farnesyl pyrophosphate (i.e., the stuff in orange in the above diagram) is attached to Ras that have been newly made in the cytoplasm by an enzyme called farnesyltransferase (i.e., Ftase).\nAnother enzyme called palmitoyltransferase (i.e., PTase) then attaches something called palmitoyl to the C-ending of the Ras’ cysteine residue, and this keeps the Ras stable in the membrane.\n\n\n4.3.8 Enzymatic Activity of Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nRas Going from its Active State to its Inactive State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRas’ Enzyme Activity\n\n\n\n\nThere are four steps to this:\n\nRas takes a proton from a catalytic water molecule using its GTP molecule’s \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate\nThe above step results in a nucleophilic hydroxide ion that then attacks the GTP’s \\(\\gamma\\)-phosphate.\nThis leads to the formation of an intermediate that has a sort of triangle pyramid shape.\nWhen GDP leaves in this reaction, this intermediate then decomposes down into GDP and phosphate.\n\n\n4.3.8.1 Going from GDP-Ras to GTP-Ras\nWe know that the Ras protein binds to something called the Son of Sevenless (i.e., SOS) without any nucleotides.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the Ras-SOS Complex\n\n\n\n\nThe Ras in the Ras-SOS complex is pretty much the same if you don’t mind the changes in the switches, the P-loop, and the Mg2+ binding region. However, there is a helix called “H” in the above diagram that is inserted within the Ras in the Ras-SOS complex."

    "section": "5.1 A Little About Ras",
    "text": "5.1 A Little About Ras\nScientists figured out that when small proteins called GTPases were activated, this caused diseases no thanks to the signalling effects that these GTPases have.\nAs of now, scientists know of three ways that these activations can happen:\n\nIncreased GEF activity (i.e., a kinase) may keep the GTPases active for a long, long time.\nThe GTPases’ genes may be mutated, so this makes it so that the proteins themselves cannot be hydrolyzed or inactivated.\nThe GAP protein - which typically removes the phosphate groups and inactivates the GTPases - is unable to do its job.\n\n\n5.1.1 Ras Cannot be Targeted\nHowever, scientists think that Ras is one of those proteins that cannot be targeted. Ras is almost like a sort of criminal mastermind that evades the police’s attention for these couple of reasons:\n\nRas has a smooth surface. It doesn’t have many pockets where a molecule can bind tightly to.\nSmall GTPase proteins don’t have spaces (i.e., cavities) for small molecules to bind to.\nGTPases communicate via something called protein protein interactions (i.e., PPIs), and current approaches aren’t really good at preventing PPIs from happening.\n\nBecause of this, the current inhibitors that we have to prevent Ras from doing its thing have looked at targeting upstream and downstream events like the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. Scientists also look at compounds that can mess up how Ras is organized.\n\n\n5.1.2 Ftase Inhibitors\nIn the past, scientists though that inhibiting Ftase - the enzyme that attaches farnesyl pyrophosphate onto the C-end of Ras and stabilizes it in the cell’s membrane would be an incredibly promising way to go about inhibting Ras. But, when they tried to put this into practice (i.e., clinical trials), they found out that this idea didn’t work so well because Ras can also be stabilized in the membrane by another kind of enzyme: geranylgeranyl transferases.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalytic Domain of the Ras Protein\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we don’t really know much about the membrane that Ras binds to, we do know that a part of it called the catalytic domain is in contact with the membrane.\nThese domains have a lot of something called cholesterol, and the “switch” region shown in the above graphic can have all sorts of conformations that scientists thing could play roles in various functions. That said, there are two kinds of conformations in GTP-bound Ras proteins.\nState 1 of the Ras protein is a version of Ras that doesn’t have interactions between a Mg2+ ion and amino acids. The state also doesn’t bind to effector proteins all that well."

    "text": "5.2 Inhibiting Ras Activity\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies to Inhibit Ras Activity\n\n\n\n\nThe above graphic shows some plausible ways that the Ras enzyme can be inhibited.\n\n5.2.1 Interference with Nucleotide Binding\nIf Ras cannot switch between its active and its inactive states, then it cannot become activated.\nHowever, there’s a big, big problem with this: the GTP molecule doesn’t really bind to Ras with that high of an affinity (i.e., the two molecules don’t bind together that strongly as well).\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Molecules Inhibiting Cdc42\n\n\n\n\nScientists have found out that small molecules can bind to GTPase called Cdc42, and it’s these molecules that can affect Ras’ conversion from its inactive to its active state.\n\n\n5.2.2 Irreversible Covalent Modification\nWhen Ras has something called a K-Ras activating mutation in its G12C location, we can target the Ras enzyme by irreversibly attaching inhibitors to Ras’ active site.\n\n\n\n\n\nIrreversibly Attaching Inhibitors to a Mutated Ras\n\n\n\n\nLuckily for us, it turns out that this is the most common kind of mutation in Ras when it comes to lung cancer. About 7% all lung cancer tumors have this kind of mutation.\n\n\n5.2.3 Stopping GTPase-GEF Interactions\nThe problem with using small molecules to inhibit Ras itself is that it also has to compete with the GEF protein. And even if the molecule in question was able to compete with GEF, it probably wouldn’t do well in the grand scheme of protein-protein interactions\nOn top of that, we could also try to use protein inhibitors instead of just small molecules. They may have higher specificities, but there are three main problems with this approach:\n\nIt may take a lot of time, money, and resources to make such a protein\nThe protein could just be degraded by the body’s enzymes\nIf the protein is too big, it might not be able to cross to certain areas like the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SOS Protein Binding to Ras\n\n\n\n\nIn the above PyMOL visualization, we see that there is an alpha helix that belongs to the SOS protein - the protein is also facing the Ras protein. The red regions and the amino acid positions suggest that that part of SOS interacts with the Ras protein.\n\n5.2.3.1 Peptide Inhibitors\nOne way we could go about stopping SOS (i.e., a GEF that activates Ras) is by making a replica (i.e., surrogate) of the SOS protein’s \\(\\alpha\\)-helix.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to Ras Binding From Alpha-Helix Primary Sequence\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the original \\(\\alpha\\)-helix isn’t that folded nor does it dissolve in water all that well. Certain amino acid changes in the primary sequence of this helix can improve its structure and also its activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure for Making an Alpha-Helix Surrogate\n\n\n\n\nThe way we usually go about making these \\(\\alpha\\)-helix variants is that we use chemistry and two reagents called 4-pentanoic acid and N-allyl glycine to make the covalent bonds between every three or four amino acids. The bond has has the following structure: C-triple bond-C-C-N.\n\n5.2.3.1.1 Raw Data\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Affinities for Different Helices\n\n\n\n\nIn the above graphs, we have three different helices: \\(\\alpha\\)H2, HBS2, and HBS3. Nonetheless, the HBS3 helix’s affinity for the Ras-GDP complex is about ten times lower than that of the SOS protein’s.\nHBS3 messes up the job of SOS when it comes to swapping out molecules in a test tube. It also makes a process called ERK activation slower in HeLa cells when they don’t have enough nutrients.\n\n\n\n5.2.3.2 Hydrocarbon Staples\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrocarbon Staple Schematics\n\n\n\n\nSomething else that we can do to make better \\(\\alpha\\)-helices is that we can also use peptides that are called hydrocarbon staples.\nWhat we’re essentially doing here is that we use different hydrocarbons (i.e., compounds that only have carbons and hydrogens on them) to link various amino acids (usually those four to seven residues apart).\nA chemical reaction called the RCM reaction is used to make this happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw, Experimental Data From Hydrocarbon Staple Peptides\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows some raw data as they pertain to different alpha helices with different hydrocarbon staples put onto them. These helices were all examined in the site of the Ras protein (i.e., with the GEF protein next to them).\nWhat we can see is that the a, c, and d helices all exhibit some sort of effect on the Kras mutant of the Ras protein (i.e., the “Kras” refers to the specific type of a Ras protein).\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrocarbon Staple Helices\n\n\n\n\nIndeed - different hydrocarbon staple peptides have different affinities for for the Kras binding pocket.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data of Hydrocarbon Staple Helices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data of Hydrocarbon Staple Helices\n\n\n\n\nOf one these helices in particular is SAH-SOS1_A_. This peptides helps inhibit Ras signalling effects in cancer patients whose cells have the G12D mutant of Ras.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Inhibiting GTPase-Effector Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\nFBPK12 Chaperon Protein Information\n\n\n\n\nIn our cells, there’s a protein called FBPK12 that pretty much just binds to other proteins.\nIf we have - say - a bifunctional peptide or a protein with two different sequences or domains (i.e., regions), what can happen is that this bifunctional peptide would bind to FBPK12 and also Ras\n\n\n\n\n\nRas Conformational States\n\n\n\n\nOne cool thing to note about Ras is that it has two different states in this context:\n\nState 1\nThis state really likes to bind to GTP, but not so much the proteins that are involved in signalling later down the road. This state also has binding pockets that reduces signalling by binding to Ras.\nState 2\nThe second state pretty much just wants to bind to effector proteins (i.e., once Ras is activated).\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Stabilizing GTPase-Protein Complexes\n\n\n\n\n\nRas Conformational States\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ras forms numerous complexes with other proteins, this may lead to the creation of new binding sites that we can then target using drug molecules. These same drugs can also stabilize the complexes.\nAs an examplee, the above compounds all bind to Ras - we know this because of this thing called screening. Compount 46 binds to site A of Ras while compounds 47 and 48 bind to site B of Ras.\nThe binding of these compounds then cause Ras to be reorganized and for the Cys118 residue to be exposed. This subsequently allows compound 49 to bind to that residue."

    "text": "5.3 Drug Targets\nThe generation of this thing called N5, N10-methylene-THF involves a reaction cycle. In the context of cancer cells, there is a crucial need for a continuous and rapid supply of dTMP to support DNA synthesis. Inhibiting the enzymes involved in this pathway can be a potential strategy to kill cancer cells. Two specific enzymes, Thymidylate Synthase (TS) and Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR), are targeted by anticancer drugs.\nOne of these drugs is FdUMP, which is a fluorinated analog of dUMP. It functions as an irreversible inhibitor of TS. FdUMP acts as a “suicide substrate,” effectively locking TS into a ternary complex with itself and tetrahydrofolate (THF).\nOn the other hand, drugs designed to target DHFR are analogs of dihydrofolate (DHF). These compounds, often referred to as anti-folate drugs, have a significantly higher affinity for DHFR, binding to it with a thousandfold greater affinity.\n\n5.3.1 Drug Resistance\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Cells and Drugs\n\n\n\n\nCancer cells are tricky because they have a lot of mutations, which means they’re not all the same. This makes it hard to kill all of them with just one medicine. Also, they can change and become resistant to the drugs we use against them.\nSome cancer cells have something called Multi-drug Resistance, or MDR. This happens because they have too many copies of a gene called Mdr1, which makes a special protein that helps them pump drugs out of the cells. So, if we use one drug to treat these cells, they not only become resistant to that drug but also to others they haven’t seen before.\nThere are proteins that work like pumps, pushing drugs out of the cells. And sometimes, the gene that makes DHFR (another protein) can become too many in the cells. When there’s too much DHFR, the cancer cells don’t respond well to certain drugs called antifolates.\nTo fight cancer effectively, we often use multiple drugs together because this makes it harder for the cancer cells to become resistant. So, it’s like attacking them from different angles to make sure we can beat them."

And in doing so, p53 also regulates the transcription of the following proteins - all of which paly a role in apoptosis:\n\nBid\nBax\npuma\nBcl-2\n\nIn all cases, the genes that encode for these proteins all have elements that are responsible for binding to p53.\n\n6.1.1 Discovering the p53 Protein\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data Suggesting the Presence of p53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data Suggesting the Presence of p53\n\n\n\n\np53 was originally found as a 53 kDa protein - it was the first “tumor suppressor” gene that was found within our cells.\n\n\n6.1.2 Overexpression of p53 in Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data Regarding the Over of p53\n\n\n\n\nWhat scientists also found out was that this p53 protein - while not very abundant in normal cells - was over-expressed in cancerous and virus-infected cells.\nAs an example, something called F9 embryonal carcinoma cells initially have high levels of p53. When these cells are exposed to retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3’,5’-phosphate (i.e., cAMP), they change into endoderm-like cells with lower p53 levels. However, when these same cells are treated with something called SV40, their p53 levels increase again.\n\n\n6.1.3 Regulating p53 Expression\n\n\n\n\n\nPulse Chase Experiments of p53 Protein Stability\n\n\n\n\nThere were five main steps to the pulse chase experiment:\n\nCells were labeled with 35S Methionine for 1 hour.\nAfter labeling, cells were rinsed with medium containing an excess of non-radioactive Methionine.\nCells were then incubated at 37°C for a specified chase period.\nSoluble proteins were extracted and subjected to immunoprecipitation using either normal mouse serum (N) or a Monoclonal Antibody (MAb) against p53 (I).\nThe proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and an autoradiogram was generated.\n\nIn different experiments, scientists can find that the amount of p53, which is a important protein in our cells, can be controlled in two main ways:\nFirst, it can be controlled by the amount of instructions (like a recipe) called p53 mRNA, or second, by how long the p53 protein stays in the cell before it’s taken away.\nThis second part is managed by a process that carefully removes and recycles the p53 protein when it’s not needed anymore.\n\n\n6.1.4 p53 in the Cell Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of p53 and Other Proteins in Cells Over Time\n\n\n\n\nIn something known as a resting 3T3 cell culture, they triggered cell activity by adding serum, which stimulates DNA synthesis. They then collected cellular extracts at various time points to analyze proteins, mRNA, and DNA.\nJust before a cell goes into the S phase, the amount of p53 protein in the cell becomes 10 to 20 times more than usual. This increase happens in both early and late G1 phases of the cell cycle, and it matches the rise in the instructions (mRNA) for making p53 protein. So, when the cell is getting ready to copy its DNA, it produces a lot more p53 to help control the process."

    "text": "6.2 Structure of Oncogenic p53\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the p53 Gene\n\n\n\n\nIn many types of human cancer, a lot of people have changes in a gene called p53. These changes can happen in different ways and places, depending on the kind of cancer and what might have caused it, like things from inside the body or outside. In cancers called carcinomas, most of the changes in p53 result in a protein that’s not quite right because of misspellings (i.e., missense mutations) in the gene.\nChanges in the p53 gene that affect how it works can happen all over the gene, especially in the middle part that’s very important and stays similar in different organisms. Other changes, like ones that make the protein shorter (i.e., frameshift mutations), usually happen in different parts of the gene. Also, it’s important to know that some specific changes are more common in certain tissues of the body.\nIn liver cancer, there’s often a change in the p53 gene where a G becomes a T at a specific place called codon 249, turning an R into an S. Also, in various types of cancer, there are common changes in p53 at certain spots, like codons 175, 249, 273, and 282, which make up a big part of the mistakes in the gene. In skin cancer, sunlight can make two Cs turn into two Ts. And when people smoke cigarettes, it can lead to changes where G and C swap to T and A, which can happen in colon cancer.\n\n6.2.1 Does p53 Cause Tumors?\nShort answer: yes.\nP53 is active in cancer cells and plays a role when cells are growing and multiplying. It also interacts with a protein called Ras, which helps cells grow. Adding the p53 gene to cells can make them live longer, even forever. However, in some cases, like when mice get a virus that causes spleen tumors, the p53 gene can get mixed up and stop working correctly, which happens quite often.\nIn the early experiments, the p53 genes that were first cloned had changes in them that made p53 work in a harmful way. These changes were found in a part of p53 that’s really important for its shape and what it does in the cell. Later, in the late 1980s, more research showed that real, unchanged p53 actually helps stop tumors from forming, instead of causing them like an oncogene would.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformation Experiments with p53 Genes and Other Genes\n\n\n\n\nIn the above experiment, rat fibroblast cells were given different versions of the p53 gene—normal p53, the cancer-causing ras gene, and a changed p53 called mutant p53 or p53-FS (frame shift). However, there wasn’t any noticeable difference in the levels of ras or mutant p53. For some parts of the experiment, the results weren’t determined (ND)."

Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA that scientists use to carry specific genes and manipulate them in cells. In this case, the scientists wanted to see what happens when a particular plasmid was added to HeLa cells.\nTo understand the results of their experiment, they measured the activity of an enzyme called CAT. Enzymes are like tiny machines that help with chemical reactions in cells. To do this, they used a special molecule called [14C] chloramphenicol. This molecule was transformed into two different forms: acetyl and diacetyl chloramphenicol, due to the action of the CAT enzyme. This allowed the scientists to see how active the CAT enzyme was in the HeLa cells and if it was changing the [14C] chloramphenicol.\nAnother part of their experiment involved something called the N-terminus domain of the p53 transactivator. The p53 protein is like a supervisor in the cell, making sure everything is working correctly. The N-terminus domain is a specific part of the p53 protein. The scientists were interested in how this domain was involved in the cell’s activities and whether it played a role in the changes they observed when they added the plasmid to the HeLa cells.\n\n\n6.3.2 p53 in Binding to DNA\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding DNA Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding DNA Binding\n\n\n\n\nIn this experiment, scientists were studying a protein called p53, specifically the “p53 WT” and a mutant version of p53, known as “Mutant p53 (273his).” These proteins are like the guards of our genetic information, and they can interact with DNA, which contains our genetic instructions.\nThe scientists found that “p53 WT” can attach itself to DNA, meaning it can bind to it. This is an important function because it helps in regulating and protecting our genetic material. On the other hand, the “Mutant p53 (273his)” couldn’t do this – it couldn’t bind to DNA like the normal, healthy version of p53.\nTo figure out where these proteins attach to DNA, the scientists used a technique involving human DNA fragments. They used special scissors-like molecules called restriction enzymes to cut the DNA into smaller pieces. These enzymes are like molecular scissors that chop the DNA into manageable sections. Then, they tagged these DNA pieces with a radioactive label called “32P.” This radioactive label helped the scientists track and locate the DNA pieces that p53 could bind to.\n\n\n6.3.3 Gene Expression Under p53’s Influence\nTo understand how the p53 protein interacts with DNA and influences gene expression, scientists conducted an experiment. They wanted to see what’s needed for p53 to bind to DNA and activate the expression of specific genes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Expression Plasmids\n\n\n\n\nFirst, they used something called “expression plasmids.” Plasmids are like tiny vehicles that carry genes into cells. In this case, they carried the p53 gene and another gene called a “reporter gene.” The reporter gene is like a marker that helps scientists see if a gene is turned on or off. By using these plasmids, the researchers aimed to test whether p53 could directly activate gene expression through its interaction with DNA.\nIn their experiment, they wanted to find out if p53 had a specific spot on the DNA, which we can call a “DNA binding site,” that allowed it to control gene activity. They also wanted to see if altered or “mutated” forms of p53 could interfere with this activation. Mutated forms of proteins have changes in their structure, which can affect how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\nBanding Profile of Several Pg Repeats\n\n\n\n\nIn this experiment, scientists were investigating how the p53 protein interacts with DNA and influences gene expression. They used a process called “gene expression in DNA binding of p53” to understand this.\nFirst, they took the p53 protein and mixed it with DNA that had a special radioactive label, which is referred to as “32P labeled PGn repeats.” This label allowed them to track and locate where the p53 protein was binding to the DNA. To confirm that p53 was indeed binding to the DNA, they used an “Ab-p53,” which is short for “antibody to p53,” to detect the presence of p53 on the DNA.\nThe experiment involved different lanes on a gel, and each lane showed something specific. In “Lane C,” they had a control sample, which contained DNA labeled with 32P. This served as a reference to compare with the other lanes.\nIn “Lane B,” they had DNA that had bound to the p53 protein and was recovered from the complex they formed. This helped them confirm that p53 was indeed binding to the DNA.\n\n\n6.3.4 Mutations in p53 and DNA Binding\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding Mutant p53 Binding to DNA\n\n\n\n\nThere are several key takeaways regarding the above barplot:\n\nWild type p53 were used to create the barplot. The data in lanes 1 and 10 use wild type p53, but lane 10 uses double the amount of wild type p53.\nLanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 all have wild type and mutant p53. There is an equal amount of wild type and mutant p53 in the plasmids used to make these lanes.\nLanes 3, 5 ,7, and 9 also have wild type and mutant p53, but there is double the amount of mutant p53 than wild type p53 in the plasmids.\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Consensus Sequence\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain Structure of p53\n\n\n\n\nThis sequence is: RRRCWWGYYY. This sequence is has a 0 to 13 base pair gap another copy of itself. The p53 protein basically forms a four-part complex (i.e., tetrameric complex) with DNA whenever it binds.\n\n\n6.3.6 How does p53 Interact with DNA?\n\n\n\n\n\np53 Binding to DNA Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nThis explanation outlines a model that helps us understand how p53, a crucial protein in our cells, interacts with specific DNA sequences. This interaction is essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining our genetic information.\nIn this model, the “cylinders” located under the DNA-binding parts of p53 represent certain regions of the p53 protein. These regions are called “loop-sheet helix regions,” and they play a significant role in making specific connections with the building blocks of DNA within what we call the “major grooves” of a specific DNA site. Think of these “major grooves” as like the spaces between the rungs of a ladder where p53 can grab onto the DNA.\nThe “arrows” in the model show us how the central, round parts of the p53 protein (known as the “globular p53 core DNA-binding domains”) are oriented concerning the repeated DNA sequences they interact with. These repeated DNA sequences are 10 base pairs long, and they have a particular pattern: “5’-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3’.” Each of these 10-base-pair sequences can be separated by varying amounts of DNA, anywhere from none to 13 base pairs.\nThe key point here is that each “quarter site” within these 10-base-pair sequences can attach itself to one part of the p53 protein, forming a complex. This model helps us visualize how p53 binds to specific DNA sequences, which is crucial for controlling gene activity and making sure our genetic instructions are followed correctly.\n\n\n6.3.7 Domain Organization of p53 and Ocurrence of Cancers\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.8 p53-DNA Complex\nIn this scientific study, researchers examined the three-dimensional structure of a complex formed between the p53 protein and DNA. This complex is essential for understanding how p53 influences the expression of genes, which are the instructions for making proteins in our bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\np53 and DNA Complex Structure\n\n\n\n\nThe crystal structure of this complex revealed some important details. The “core domain” of the p53 protein primarily attaches itself to a specific sequence of DNA, which is called a “pentamer consensus sequence.” This sequence is made up of five DNA building blocks (pentamer) and has a specific pattern: “PuPuPuC(A/T)-(T/A)G.” The core domain of p53 interacts extensively with the bases and phosphate groups of this DNA sequence.\nWhat’s interesting is that not only does the core domain attach to this specific pentamer consensus sequence, but it also connects with base pairs that are located outside of this pentamer sequence. This suggests that not just one pentamer, but part of another pentamer (the adjacent one) is also needed for the binding to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information about p53 and DNA’s Binding Site\n\n\n\n\nIn this description, scientists are talking about how specific parts of the p53 protein interact with DNA, which is crucial for controlling gene expression and maintaining our genetic information.\nFirst, they mention “R248,” which is a specific region of the p53 protein. R248 is known to attach itself to the “minor groove” of DNA. The minor groove is like a narrow space in the DNA’s structure. R248 interacts with a specific DNA sequence that is rich in “AT” base pairs. Additionally, it forms what are called “salt bridges” with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA. Think of these salt bridges as molecular connections that help hold the p53 protein in place on the DNA.\nNext, they discuss “R273,” another part of the p53 protein. R273 binds to the “major groove” of DNA, which is a larger space in the DNA’s structure compared to the minor groove. Like R248, R273 also forms salt bridges with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA. These connections help anchor the p53 protein in its place on the DNA.\nIn addition to these DNA interactions, R273 is also involved in other interactions within the p53 protein itself. For example, it forms a salt bridge with a molecule called “Asp.” These interactions are important because they help p53 function correctly in regulating gene expression and other cellular processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nG245 is Necessary for Loop Conformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of Mutations on p53-DNA Complex\n\n\n\n\nSome structural mutations of p53 can weaken the structure of p53 in the cell (i.e., in vivo)."

When MDM2 interacts with p53, it inhibits p53’s ability to carry out this transactivation process, essentially putting a brake on p53’s function.\nTo understand this regulation better, the scientists conducted an experiment. They looked at the activity of a “reporter gene” in the presence or absence of MDM2. The reporter gene is a marker used to measure the activity of p53. By examining this reporter gene’s behavior with and without MDM2, they could determine how MDM2 affects p53’s ability to activate other genes.\n\n6.4.1 MDM2 in Cancer Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractions Between MDM2 and p53\n\n\n\n\nFirst, it’s important to know that MDM2 is often found in higher amounts in many cancer cells. This overexpression of MDM2 can be problematic because MDM2 can bind to p53 and prevent it from functioning properly. P53 is a protein that acts as a guardian of our DNA, ensuring that our cells don’t grow out of control and become cancerous. When MDM2 interacts with p53, it suppresses p53’s activity, which can be harmful in the context of cancer.\nTo counteract this, scientists are exploring the development of “p53-MDM2 inhibitors.” These are substances or drugs that can block the interaction between p53 and MDM2. By limiting these interactions, it’s possible to activate p53, allowing it to carry out its essential role in controlling cell growth and preventing cancer development.\n\n\n6.4.2 Small Molecule Inhibitors of MDM2\n\n\n\n\n\nNultins Binding to p53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data Regarding Nultin Binding\n\n\n\n\nMDM2 is a protein that plays a role in regulating another important protein called p53, which is known as the “guardian of the genome” because it helps maintain the stability of our DNA and prevent the development of cancer.\nThe researchers found that nutlins have a strong ability to bind to MDM2, and they do so at a specific location called the “p53 binding site.” This binding interaction between nutlins and MDM2 occurs with high affinity, meaning they stick together very tightly."

These mutations don’t have a significant impact on the overall shape or stability of the protein.\nLocal distortion mutations (e.g., R249S): Other mutations cause a distortion in the structure of the protein, mainly near its DNA-binding site. These mutations tend to make the protein less stable, but the destabilization is relatively minor, less than 2 kcal/mol (kilocalories per mole).\nGlobal unfolding mutations (e.g., mutations in the β sandwich): Some mutations cause a widespread disruption in the protein’s structure. These mutations result in a significant destabilization of the protein, exceeding 3 kcal/mol.\n\n\n6.5.1 Peptide-Based Rescues\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivation of p53 Binding Peptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivation of p53 Binding Peptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivation of p53 Binding Peptides\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve this reactivation, scientists are working on the design of certain peptides. Peptides are like short chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. These peptides are created to interact with the mutant p53 protein and potentially restore its function.\nIn their study, they focus on a protein called 53BP2, which is known to bind to p53. This interaction enhances the ability of p53 to activate genes and specifically promotes its role in causing cell death (apoptosis).\n53BP2 binds to p53 at the same spot where p53 usually binds to DNA. This binding site involves three specific regions, referred to as “loops,” that make direct contact with p53.\nTo design peptides that can mimic this interaction, the researchers synthesized three different peptides corresponding to these three loops, which they labeled as CDB1, CDB2, and CDB3."

    "section": "7.1 Protein Folding",
    "text": "7.1 Protein Folding\nLet’s dive into a challenging question: How do proteins find their correct shapes? It’s a puzzle that scientists have been trying to solve.\nOne idea to understand this process is to consider all the possible shapes a protein can take. But here’s where the problem gets interesting, and it’s called the Cyrus Levinthal Paradox, named after the scientist who first described it in 1969.\nImagine a protein with n amino acid building blocks. Each of these amino acids can rotate around two special angles, \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\), giving us a total of \\(2(n - 1)\\) possible angles to consider. And for each of these angles, there are three stable conformations: one called trans and two gauche positions.\nNow, if we attempt to explore all the possible conformations that this protein could take, we’d end up with an astronomically large number—around \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) possible shapes! That’s a mind-boggling amount.\nHere’s the catch: if a protein could try out a new shape every \\(10^{-13}\\) seconds (which is the rate at which single bonds reorient), it would take an incredibly long time to test all these possibilities. For instance, if we consider a protein with just 100 amino acids, it would take roughly \\(10^{86}\\) seconds. To put that into perspective, the universe is around 20 billion years old, or about \\(6 \\times 10^{17}\\) seconds. So, the time required for a protein to explore all its possible shapes would be greater than the apparent age of the universe itself!\nThis paradox tells us that proteins don’t search through all their possible shapes one by one. Instead, they seem to have a much faster and more efficient way of finding their correct, functional shapes. In fact, proteins in living organisms, like E. coli, can grow and fold into their shapes in mere minutes, which is a fascinating and efficient feat that continues to captivate scientists.\n\n7.1.1 Anfinsen’s Experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Anfinsen’s Experiment\n\n\n\n\nIn this Anfinsen’s experiment, scientists discovered that proteins have a remarkable ability to fold themselves into their natural shapes, all on their own, under normal, everyday conditions found in living organisms. It’s like a magic trick that happens inside our bodies.\nWhat’s even more mind-blowing is that the sequence of amino acids, which are like the building blocks of proteins, contains all the instructions needed to define the protein’s 3D structure. In simpler terms, the order of these amino acids acts like a blueprint for the protein’s final shape and, consequently, its job in the body.\nThis discovery shed light on the fact that there are no mysterious, magical factors needed for proteins to fold correctly. Everything they need is right there in their genetic code. It’s like saying, “You have all the tools you need; now, go do your job.” This insight was groundbreaking and has deepened our understanding of how proteins function in our bodies.\n\n\n7.1.2 Funnel-Shaped Energy Landscape\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Funnel Landscape of Protein Folding\n\n\n\n\nProteins start off with lots of potential shapes, like different paths down the sides of the funnel. But they all want to reach the same ultimate goal: their native state, a specific, energetically stable shape.\nNow, here’s where the action begins. In a refolding experiment, proteins have to make choices along the way. Think of these choices like deciding which route to take down the funnel. The key is to avoid getting stuck in local minima, which are like little pits or traps in the landscape. Proteins have to pick the smoothest, most energy-efficient path that leads them to their stable, native shape.\n\n\n7.1.3 In Vivo Folding\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Vivo Folding of Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about protein folding in cells is that the process occurs in super cramped spaces.\n\n7.1.3.1 In Bacteria\nInside the cell, there’s a bit of a competition going on. The newborn protein, called a nascent chain, needs to find its way to the right shape. But sometimes, it can get distracted and form unproductive associations with other big molecules, like a player getting mixed up in the wrong team.\nThis is where the group of proteins, known as Molecular Chaperones, steps in. They’re like the experienced guides who know the perfect trails to follow. Some of these chaperones have names like DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, GroES, and Trigger Factor. They act as helpers, making sure the nascent chain takes the right path and doesn’t get lost in the bustling cell.\nThese chaperones are like the heroes of protein folding, ensuring that the competition for productive folding doesn’t end in chaos. They guide the nascent chain to its correct, functional shape, making sure the protein is ready to do its job in the cell. It’s a remarkable teamwork process inside the microscopic world of bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nConformational States of Folded Proteins\n\n\n\n\nWhen a protein is made, it can go into one of several shapes.\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Protein Quality Control in Cells\n\n\n\n\n\nProtein Synthesis Inside Cells\n\n\n\n\nWhen new proteins are made, they’re like raw materials that need some work. So, these freshly synthesized protein chains are sent to a place in the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, they get a bit of a makeover, with modifications like glycosylation, and they’re also given a hand to fold into their proper, three-dimensional shape. This is where special proteins called molecular chaperones come into play. Think of them as the cell’s fashion designers, helping proteins look their best.\nNow, proteins that are correctly folded and ready for action get a one-way ticket to the Golgi complex. They’re wrapped up in membranes, kind of like a gift in a box, and delivered to where they’re needed in the cell.\nBut, here’s where the plot thickens. If a protein is poorly folded or just not up to par, a quality control system springs into action. It detects these “problematic” proteins and decides they need more work. These proteins are not allowed to leave the ER but are sent down another path called the unfolded protein response. Here, they face a system that acts like a recycling center, using a process called ubiquitin-proteasome to break down and dispose of the proteins that didn’t quite make the cut."

    "section": "7.2 Amyloids",
    "text": "7.2 Amyloids\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions Containing Stained Amyloids\n\n\n\n\nThe term amyloids was coined by a scientist called Virchow because these substances could be found in certain abnormal tissues in the human body. What’s interesting is that when you add iodine and sulfuric acid to these tissues, they change color. It’s kind of like a chemical reaction that makes these tissues stain a certain way. This staining is similar to what happens in plants with something called starch.\nAnother distinctive trait of amyloids is that they can bind to certain dyes, like Congo Red (CR), Thioflavin T (ThT), and Thioflavin S (ThS). It’s like they have a special affinity for these dyes, which can help scientists identify them. There’s also a protein called the serum amyloid P component (SAP) that’s associated with amyloids.\n\n7.2.1 Physical Characteristics of Amyloids\nAmyloids are like the rebels of the biological world because they’re insoluble under normal conditions inside a living organism. Imagine trying to dissolve a pebble in water; it just won’t work. However, under specific conditions with low ionic strength (a measure of salt concentration), they become a bit more cooperative, forming a gel-like suspension.\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing Amyloids Up Close\n\n\n\n\nWhen amyloids deposit in the body, they don’t just sit there on their own. They’re like precious gems embedded within a rock, surrounded by other tissue components.\nWhat makes amyloids truly unique is their structure. They form long, non-branching fibrils, like tiny threads, that are about 7.5 to 10 nanometers in diameter and can be quite long, ranging from 3,000 to 100,000 nanometers. These fibrils aren’t solo actors; they develop from several intermediates or proto-fibrils, which have a special arrangement called cross \\(\\beta\\)-sheet structures.\nAmyloids are also known for their ability to trigger other substances to adopt the same misfolded structure, like a domino effect. This is called seeding and cross-seeding. It’s like one misfolded protein convincing others to join the misfolded club.\nIn addition, amyloids are tough cookies. They’re resistant to being broken down by enzymes, a process called proteolysis, and they can withstand harsh conditions without losing their structure.\n\n\n7.2.2 Amyloid Folding in vivo\n\n\n\n\n\nAmyloid Folding Stages\n\n\n\n\nOne of the intriguing aspects of amyloid formation is that it can happen from both folded and unfolded precursor proteins. Imagine you have pieces of a puzzle, some neatly arranged, and some all mixed up. Both can lead to the creation of the final picture.\nNow, think of these precursor proteins as having different states. There’s the unfolded state (U), the intermediate state (I), and the native, or folded, state (N). These states are like different stages in solving the puzzle, from scattered pieces to a completed picture.\nWhat’s really interesting is that moving from one state to another isn’t as simple as just changing your mind. There’s a high energy barrier, like a big hill, that separates these states. Climbing this hill is tough work, and it’s not easy for the protein to transition from U to I or N.\nUnder normal, physiological conditions, the native state (N) is the most stable and commonly populated state. It’s like the preferred arrangement of puzzle pieces. However, there’s another state, N*, which can exist as a result of the protein’s natural wiggles and jiggles, known as thermal fluctuations. This transition has a lower energy barrier, making it easier for the protein to explore different conformations, similar to how a puzzle piece might shift slightly as you’re working on it.\n\n7.2.2.1 Steps in Amyloid Folding\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Amyloids Fold in an Organism\n\n\n\n\nAt the start, when proteins begin to associate with each other, it’s not an easy task. The initial association events are unfavorable, like trying to bring together pieces of a puzzle that don’t quite fit. However, at some point, something special happens. We reach a critical size, often referred to as the nucleus. Once this nucleus is formed, further protein associations become much more favorable. It’s like finally finding the right piece of the puzzle that helps you build the rest of it effortlessly.\nNow, there’s another scenario where the initial association events are actually favorable. Here, proteins come together and form amorphous aggregates, often referred to as oligomers. These are like the starting points, but they’re not yet in their final, structured form. However, some of these oligomers of a certain size undergo conformational changes. It’s like pieces of the puzzle adjusting and snapping into place. These changes lead to the formation of amyloid seed fibrils, which then serve as the basis for more associations.\nIn a different scenario, once the initial association events are favorable, it’s like the puzzle pieces fitting well right from the beginning. After the formation of the amyloidogenic monomer (a protein unit that’s ready for amyloid formation), the association steps become highly favorable, and there’s a low energy barrier. It’s like finding the right puzzle piece right away and smoothly connecting it to the rest of the puzzle.\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Amyloid Diseases in a Nutshell\nFirst and foremost, aging is a major risk factor for both sporadic (not inherited) and inherited amyloid diseases. It’s like the clock is ticking, and as we get older, our risk of developing these diseases increases. One reason for this is that aging can lead to deficiencies in stress-responsive signaling, essentially disrupting the cell’s ability to manage protein balance, which is called proteostasis. When protein balance is compromised, tissues that can’t easily regenerate are particularly vulnerable.\nNow, let’s talk about mutations in amyloidogenic proteins. While not every amyloid disease is directly caused by mutations, they often play a role. Think of these mutations as puzzle pieces that make the puzzle-solving process more challenging. Mutations within these proteins can make them more prone to forming amyloids. They do this by destabilizing the normal, non-amyloidogenic state of the protein, pushing it towards partially folded states. In these partially folded states, certain amino acids become exposed and are more likely to trigger the formation of amyloids. This speeds up the process of tissue degeneration, especially in tissues that can’t renew themselves after damage."

    "text": "7.3 Transthyretin (i.e., TTR) Amyloidoses\nTTR, or transthyretin, is a blood protein that we can find in our bloodstream at a concentration of about 5 μM. This protein has a couple of important jobs. It transports retinol binding protein, which carries retinol, a form of vitamin A. TTR is like a reliable courier for these essential nutrients.\nBut that’s not all. TTR also plays a role in carrying thyroxine (T4) in the blood of rodents, although its significance in humans is a bit different.\nIn terms of its structure, TTR is made up of 127 amino acids, and it forms a tetramer under normal physiological conditions. This means it exists as a group of four TTR molecules bound together. In this form, it can carry two units of retinol binding protein. It’s like a teamwork arrangement, with each TTR tetramer carrying these valuable cargo units.\nHowever, sometimes things don’t go as planned. TTR can undergo misfolding outside of cells, and it assembles into various aggregated structures. These assemblies aren’t normal and lead to degenerative diseases. It’s like TTR taking a wrong turn and ending up causing trouble instead of smoothly transporting its cargo.\n\n7.3.1 Structure of TTR\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of TTR\n\n\n\n\nLet’s explore the structure of transthyretin (TTR), the protein we just talked about. TTR’s structure is like a beautifully organized team, and understanding it can give us insights into how it functions.\nTTR forms a tetramer, which is a group of four TTR molecules that join together. Picture it like a tight-knit squad working together. This tetramer structure is folded in a way that features β-sheet structures, which are like specific patterns that the protein follows. Within this tetramer, there are four interfaces, or interaction points, among the subunits, keeping the team together.\nNow, TTR isn’t just hanging out on its own; it has a very important job of carrying thyroxine (T4) in the bloodstream. To do this, TTR interacts with T4 using specific amino acids, namely Glu54 and Lys15. It’s like a carefully choreographed dance where TTR and T4 engage in a precise partnership.\nWithin TTR, there’s a special spot called the T4 binding pocket. This pocket is both hydrophobic, meaning it repels water, and it has three pairs of hydrophobic regions. These regions are often referred to as the halogen binding pocket (HBP) because they are occupied by iodine atoms of T4. It’s like TTR’s way of securely holding T4 in place.\n\n\n7.3.2 TTR Diseases\nFirst, TTR amyloid diseases can be linked to changes or mutations in the TTR gene. In fact, more than 100 different point mutations have been identified. These mutations can be like a twist in the puzzle, making it more complex. But here’s the intriguing part: even the normal, or wild-type (WT), TTR can be involved in amyloid-related conditions. It’s not just about the mutations.\nWhen TTR amyloids deposit, they can be found both outside and within heart muscle cells, specifically cardiomyocytes. This deposition leads to a condition known as senile systemic amyloidosis (SAA), which affects around 15% of men older than 80 and even some as young as 60. It’s like an unexpected challenge in the puzzle of aging.\nNow, the mutated forms of TTR are even more puzzling. These mutations can lead to various conditions, including familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), and central nervous system-selective amyloidoses (CNSA). It’s like having different versions of the puzzle, each with its unique set of challenges.\nHere’s the twist: mutant TTR proteins are often heterozygous, meaning they contain a mix of subunits from the normal, or wild-type, TTR and the mutant TTR. This mixture creates a unique environment that can lead to the early formation of amyloids in these conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint Mutations in the TTR Protein\n\n\n\n\nIn L55P FAP, the onset of symptoms happens at a relatively early age, at around 20 years. It’s like the condition knocks on the door of the affected individuals when they’re young.\nOn the other hand, there’s V30M FAP, which presents slightly later. In the Portuguese population, symptoms of V30M FAP typically become noticeable around the age of 30 years. It’s like this form of FAP chooses to reveal itself a bit later in life.\nThese variations in the timing of symptom onset highlight the diversity and complexity of FAP. Understanding when and how different forms of the disease appear is crucial for diagnosis and management. It’s like piecing together a puzzle where the timing of symptom onset is one of the key pieces to consider.\n\n\n7.3.3 Mechanism of Formation for TTR\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Structures of TTR\n\n\n\n\nTTR is known for its tetrameric structure, which means it’s made up of four TTR molecules that come together. In this puzzle, the location of point mutations is crucial. These mutations influence the protein’s amyloidogenicity, or its ability to form amyloids, and also impact the type of disease that develops. It’s like specific pieces of the puzzle that significantly affect the final picture.\nOne of the key mutations, V30M TTR, is located right in the hydrophobic core of the protein. This core is like the central part of the puzzle, and the V30M mutation directly impacts it. Another mutation, L55P, is found in a specific beta-strand of the protein. This strand is like one of the patterned pieces that makes up the overall puzzle.\nThe V122I mutation, on the other hand, is close to the C terminus, which is like the end part of the puzzle, and it’s also located at the dimer-dimer interface, where two parts of the tetramer meet. This mutation can significantly affect the interaction between these subunits.\nAnd then there’s the T119M mutation, which is involved in stabilizing the quaternary structure, the overall arrangement of the tetramer. It’s like the glue that holds the pieces of the puzzle together. This mutation not only stabilizes the structure but also slows down the rate at which the tetramer falls apart.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding TTR Structure\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we have the V30M and L55P variants of TTR, and they share a characteristic: they are less stable in their tetrameric states. It’s like these variants have some wobbly pieces, and the tetramer structure isn’t as secure as it should be. This reduced stability is a key factor in their amyloidogenicity, or their tendency to form amyloids.\nOn the other hand, there’s the V122I TTR variant and the wild-type (WT) TTR. These two have a similar level of stability when it comes to their tetrameric states. It’s like they have strong, well-fitted puzzle pieces that keep their tetramer structures intact.\nNow, here’s the twist: the T119M variant of TTR is even more stable than the WT TTR. This is quite surprising because it’s like finding a puzzle piece that’s even more secure and robust than the original. This increased stability is particularly intriguing and could play a role in its unique properties.\nWhat’s perplexing about this puzzle of stability is that V30M and L55P, as well as V122I and WT TTR, show similar levels of stability despite being different variants. It’s like having two different-looking puzzle pieces that surprisingly fit together perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding TTR Variants’ Pathogenicity\n\n\n\n\nExperimental data suggests that the L55P variant of TTR is the likeliest to cause disease. This variant folds 9.2 times faster than normal (i.e., wild type) TTR. Another variant to note is the V22I variant - this one folds about 3.6 times faster than wild type TTR.\n\n\n7.3.4 Disassociation Pathways\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism of Disassociation Within TTR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.5 Stability of TTR\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding Disassociation Pathway Among TTR\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first, for TTR to turn into amyloids, it needs to go through a specific process. The initial step, which is often the slowest and rate-limiting, is the dissociation of the TTR tetramer. Imagine this as the moment when the four members of the tetramer go their separate ways, breaking apart from their close-knit group.\nOnce this dissociation occurs, it sets the stage for the next phase of the cascade. The natively folded monomer, which is the individual unit of TTR in its normal, well-structured state, must undergo partial denaturation. Think of this as the monomer starting to lose its usual shape and structure, becoming “competent” to misassemble into various aggregate forms.\nThese aggregates can take the form of oligomers, which are like smaller clusters, or they can evolve into the distinctive amyloid fibrils. It’s like the monomers going through a transformation, and depending on the conditions, they can become different types of structures, just like Lego pieces that can be assembled in various ways.\nNow, here’s the interesting part: certain molecules, like thyroxine (T4), can stabilize the TTR tetramer. This stabilization prevents amyloidogenesis, which is the process of amyloid formation. It’s like T4 acting as a shield, making sure the tetramer stays intact and doesn’t break apart to start the cascade.\n\n7.3.5.1 Experimental Data\n\n\n\n\n\nTetramer Formation in a Portuguese Family\n\n\n\n\nA Portugueses family were found to have the V30M variant of TTR - a variant that can readily cause diseases in one of their alleles and the T119M variant in another allele (which is responsible for suppressing diseases).\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding T119M Mutant of TTR"

    "section": "7.4 TTR Drug Design and Discovery",
    "text": "7.4 TTR Drug Design and Discovery\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of TTR and Experimental Data Regarding Inhibition of T4\n\n\n\n\nFirst, TTR has a unique ability to bind to two T4 hormone molecules at the dimer interface. Imagine this as a special receptor on TTR that can hold onto two T4 molecules simultaneously. It’s like TTR is acting as a double-handed catcher for T4.\nIn our bloodstream, approximately 20-25% of the T4 is bound to TTR. The remaining 75% of T4 is bound to a different protein called globulin. This division of labor ensures that T4 is efficiently carried through the bloodstream. It’s like a team effort with both TTR and globulin playing a crucial role in transporting T4.\nNow, here’s where things get really interesting. When T4 binds to TTR, it has a unique effect. It reduces the dissociation of the TTR tetramer. In other words, it helps TTR stay together in its four-part structure. This is like a stabilizing force that ensures TTR doesn’t break apart easily.\nWhat’s particularly exciting is that the T4 binding sites on TTR are utilized in the design and discovery of drug molecules. Scientists leverage these sites to create drugs that can interact with TTR, either by mimicking the effects of T4 or by interfering with TTR’s functions. It’s like using the same key to unlock different doors in a complex building.\n\n7.4.1 Challenges Regarding TTR Drugs\n\n\n\n\n\nTTR Drug Structures\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping drugs for TTR-related conditions is no simple task. One of the primary challenges is specificity. In our blood plasma, there are over 4000 different proteins, making it a crowded environment. Additionally, albumin, another protein in plasma, has a tendency to bind with many small molecules. So, any drug targeting TTR must be specific and not mistakenly interact with other proteins or receptors in the bloodstream. It’s like trying to single out one particular individual in a crowded room.\nAnother critical consideration is that these drugs must not interfere with thyroid receptors. Thyroxine (T4), the thyroid hormone, plays a vital role in our bodies, and drugs targeting TTR should not disrupt its function.\nNow, when it comes to designing drugs to prevent amyloid formation in TTR, scientists typically focus on small molecule ligands. These ligands often consist of two aromatic rings. These rings can be linked directly to each other (known as a biaryl) or separated by linkers of varying chemical structures. It’s like combining two important puzzle pieces.\nHere’s where it gets interesting: one of these aromatic rings is usually modified with a polar substituent, which means it has a part that’s attracted to water. The other ring often features halogenated substituents, alkyl groups, or sometimes a combination of these. It’s like having a special tool with a unique handle and head for a specific job.\nThis specific design and structure of small molecule TTR ligands are crucial for their effectiveness in preventing amyloid formation. They act like keys that fit into TTR’s locks, stopping it from forming harmful amyloid structures.\n\n\n7.4.2 Bivalent Drug Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nBivalent Inhibitors Against TTR\n\n\n\n\nMonovalent drug binding is like a handshake; it’s a bit more casual. In this approach, drugs have a weaker affinity for their target proteins. This means they are not as tightly bound and have a higher degree of freedom, similar to having more room to move around. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off. Since the binding is weaker, drugs can be more easily displaced from the binding site, which is like letting go of the handshake.\nOn the other hand, bivalent drug binding is more like a firm, unbreakable handshake. Here, drugs are linked together by a ‘rigid’ chemical linker. This linker can even have interactions with the proteins themselves. As a result, the affinity, or the strength of the bond, is much stronger. Drugs in a bivalent binding scenario have less degree of freedom, which means they are less likely to be displaced from the binding site. It’s like having a handshake that you can’t easily let go of.\n\n7.4.2.1 Bivalent Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Bivalent Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\nThe thing about bivalent inhibitors is that their structures are linked through their phenol groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw Data Regarding Bivalent Drug Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Clinical Trials\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Data Regarding FDA Approved Drugs\n\n\n\n\nThe first drug, Diflunisal, is a derivative of salicylic acid and has properties that make it an analgesic (pain reliever) and anti-inflammatory agent. However, it’s also a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, which can potentially pose problems for TTR cardiomyopathy patients by impairing blood flow. It’s like a double-edged sword with both benefits and potential drawbacks.\nDiflunisal’s interaction with TTR is unique. It binds to TTR with negative cooperativity, which means that it has two binding constants (Kd1 and Kd2). The first binding constant (Kd1) is relatively strong at 75 nM, while the second one (Kd2) is weaker at 1100 nM. This dual interaction is like a handshake that starts strong and then loosens up a bit.\nWhile these drugs have only modest binding affinity to TTR and low selectivity among plasma proteins, they have some crucial advantages. They have high oral bioavailability, which means they can be taken by mouth and still effectively reach the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, they maintain high concentrations, which is like ensuring a steady supply of soldiers to guard against potential threats.\nThe most exciting part is that these drugs have the ability to stabilize TTR and inhibit amyloid formation. It’s like having bodyguards that not only protect but also prevent trouble from happening in the first place."

    "text": "Comparison Between a Healthy Brain and One with AD\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a long-term brain disorder that affects a lot of people, accounting for 60 to 70% of dementia cases. Dementia is a condition that makes it hard for people to remember things and think clearly. Around 26 million people are affected by Alzheimer’s.\nOne of the first signs of Alzheimer’s is short-term memory loss. This means that people with Alzheimer’s may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. As the disease progresses, more serious symptoms show up.\nIn the later stages of Alzheimer’s, people may struggle with language, have trouble recognizing where they are, and experience a loss of control over their body functions. This can be really tough for both the person with Alzheimer’s and their loved ones. Unfortunately, in severe cases, Alzheimer’s can lead to death."

    "section": "8.1 Factors Involved in Alzheimer’s Disease",
    "text": "8.1 Factors Involved in Alzheimer’s Disease\n\n8.1.1 Genetic Factors\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) has different types, and one way to look at it is through genetics. This means that the disease can sometimes be linked to our family history, or it can happen without any clear family connection.\nIn cases where Alzheimer’s is passed down through families, specific genes are involved. Think of genes as instructions for our bodies. In familial cases, mutations (changes) in genes related to Alzheimer’s are usually found. For example, there can be mutations in the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) gene or in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. These gene mutations are often responsible for the majority of cases where Alzheimer’s is inherited within a family.\nHowever, it’s important to note that the type of Alzheimer’s that runs in families is not very common. It’s considered rare, with fewer than 0.1% of people affected by this familial form of the disease.\n\n8.1.1.1 Apolipoprotein E\nWhen it comes to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and genetics, there’s another important gene to know about, called apolipoprotein E (APOE). This gene is connected to what we call sporadic cases of the disease. Unlike familial cases, where Alzheimer’s is passed down in families, sporadic cases seem to happen more randomly.\nIn the case of APOE, there is a specific version of the gene called APOE E4 allele, and having this version increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. If someone has one copy of APOE E4 (heterozygotes), their risk goes up three times, and if they have two copies (homozygotes), the risk increases by 15 times. Additionally, having APOE E4 can make Alzheimer’s start earlier, reducing the age of onset by 10 years.\nNow, you might wonder how APOE E4 is involved in causing Alzheimer’s. Well, this gene plays a role in transporting cholesterol in the brain. But when it comes to Alzheimer’s, APOE E4 seems to act in a way that contributes to the buildup of a protein called amyloid β (Aβ). This buildup leads to the formation of plaques in the brain, a key feature of Alzheimer’s pathology. So, in a way, APOE E4 is like a “pathological chaperon” because it encourages the formation of these harmful protein deposits\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Risk Factors\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is influenced by various risk factors beyond genetics. One important factor is the brain’s reserve capacity, which refers to its ability to handle damage or changes. When this reserve capacity decreases, it can make the brain more vulnerable to the development of Alzheimer’s.\nSeveral health conditions and lifestyle choices can contribute to this decreased reserve capacity and increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. Vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), coronary heart disease, and hypertension (high blood pressure), play a role. Other risk factors include hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels), smoking, obesity, diabetes, and brain injuries. These factors can set off a chain of events that initiate the pathological cascade leading to Alzheimer’s.\nOn a positive note, there are actions individuals can take to reduce their risk of Alzheimer’s. Certain dietary choices, like consuming vitamins B12 and folate to control homocysteine levels, can be beneficial. Antioxidants found in vitamins C and E, as well as unsaturated fatty acids, are also agents that may help lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. So, by making healthy lifestyle choices, individuals can potentially reduce their risk of Alzheimer’s and support the overall well-being of their brains.\n\n\n8.1.3 Amyloid Hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Amyloid Hypothesis\n\n\n\n\nThe Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a gene located on chromosome 21. Interestingly, this gene is associated with both Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Down Syndrome.\nIn Down Syndrome, individuals have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which means they also have an extra copy of the APP gene. This genetic situation is linked to an increased production of a protein called amyloid beta (Aβ). High levels of Aβ can lead to the formation of plaques in the brain, which is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer’s.\nWhat’s particularly notable is that individuals with Down Syndrome often show an early onset of Alzheimer’s Disease. The extra copy of the APP gene, along with other factors related to Down Syndrome, contributes to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s at a younger age in this population.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaques in Alzheimer’s Disease\n\n\n\n\nPlaques are abnormal deposits that form outside of nerve cells and are made up of a protein called amyloid beta (Aβ). These plaques are surrounded by structures called ‘dystrophic neurites,’ which are damaged nerve cell processes, as well as ‘reactive astrocytes’ and ‘microglia,’ which are types of support cells in the brain. The presence of these plaques is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer’s disease.\nTangles, on the other hand, are found inside nerve cells and are made up of a protein called tau. In Alzheimer’s, tau becomes hyper-phosphorylated, which means it has an excess of phosphate groups attached to it. This abnormal phosphorylation causes tau to clump together, forming tangles within the nerve cells. These tangles are another hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\n8.1.4 APP Processing\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing of the APP Protein\n\n\n\n\nThe Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a significant protein in the body, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS). It’s a large protein, made up of approximately 700 amino acids. The structure of APP includes a sizable extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain that spans the cell membrane, and a short cytoplasmic region inside the cell.\nAPP plays various roles in the body, contributing to essential functions like neuronal growth, transport, and signaling. Despite its importance, interestingly, mice that lack the APP gene seem to develop normally and exhibit no apparent abnormalities. This suggests that while APP has important functions, there may be redundancy or compensatory mechanisms in place in mice that allow for normal development even in the absence of APP.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Processing of the APP Protein\n\n\n\n\nAfter a specific cleavage by an enzyme called α-secretase, a soluble extracellular domain is produced, known as APPsα. This cleavage is a crucial step in the normal processing of APP.\nFollowing the α-secretase cleavage, two important fragments are generated: α-CTF (C-terminal fragment) and AICD (APP Intracellular Domain). These fragments have distinct roles in cellular processes.\nAdditionally, another product of APP processing is p3, which is a truncated form of amyloid beta (Aβ) with a size of 3 kD. Aβ is a protein implicated in the formation of plaques in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.\nThe term “secretase” refers to enzymes, including α-secretase, that are designed to cleave transmembrane proteins like APP.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrafficking of APP\n\n\n\n\nIn neurons, the movement of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a dynamic process involving various cellular compartments. Here’s a breakdown of the trafficking of APP in neurons:\n\nSynthesis and Transport: Newly synthesized APP, shown in purple, is produced within the cell and transported from the Golgi apparatus down the axon (long extension of a nerve cell) (1) or into a cellular compartment in the cell body (2).\nInsertion into Cell Surface: Once APP reaches its destination, it is inserted into the cell surface. At this point, some of the APP undergoes cleavage by α-secretase (6), leading to the generation of the soluble extracellular domain known as APPsα (shown in green). This fragment diffuses away from the cell surface.\nReinternalization into Endosomes: Part of the APP that is not cleaved may be reinternalized into endosomes (3). Inside these endosomes, amyloid beta (Aβ) is generated (shown in blue). Aβ is a protein fragment associated with the formation of plaques in Alzheimer’s disease.\nEndosome Recycling: Following the generation of Aβ, the endosome can recycle back to the cell surface (4). During this recycling process, Aβ and another fragment, APPsβ, are released.\nTransport to Golgi: Alternatively, there’s a pathway where the endosomes transport back to the Golgi apparatus before APP cleavage (5). This transport is mediated by cellular structures called retromers.\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Genetics and Mutations\nThere are several mutations associated with the genes encoding the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and γ-secretase that contribute to early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A total of 32 mutations in the APP gene and 193 mutations in the γ-secretase gene have been identified. These mutations lead to autosomal dominant, fully penetrant AD, meaning that individuals with these mutations are very likely to develop the disease, often at an earlier age.\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations Associated with Alzheimer’s Disease\n\n\n\n\nTo explore these mutations in more detail, one can refer to the Alzheimer Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia Mutation Database, which is available online at [http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADmutations/](http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADmutations/.\nOne notable impact of γ-secretase mutations is an increase in the production of a specific form of amyloid beta (Aβ), called Aβ42, relative to Aβ40. Aβ42 is less soluble and more toxic than Aβ40. This difference is due to Aβ42 containing two additional hydrophobic amino acids, Ile and Ala. Aβ42 has a tendency to aggregate rapidly and form stable oligomers, which are structures that consist of a few linked molecules.\nAdditionally, a specific familial mutation in the APP gene, known as the Swedish mutation, involves changes in amino acids (K to N and M to L). This mutation results in altered processing of the APP protein, leading to increased production of Aβ.\nFurthermore, duplications in the APP gene have been associated with familial forms of Alzheimer’s disease."

    "text": "8.2 Aggregations of A\\(\\beta\\) in Alzheimer’s Disease\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Mechanisms of Protein Aggregation\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanism of the aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathogenesis is complex and involves the formation of structures known as protofibrils. The aggregation process is illustrated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles, which show the distribution of different forms of Aβ over time.\nIn the provided profiles, two main peaks are observed. The left peak corresponds to the protofibril peak, indicating the time-dependent growth of protofibrils. Protofibrils are intermediate structures in the aggregation pathway and are considered precursors to the formation of larger fibrils and plaques in the brain, which are characteristic of AD.\nConcomitantly, the right peak corresponds to the monomeric peak, representing the monomeric form of Aβ. Monomers are individual units of Aβ before they aggregate into larger structures. The decline of the monomeric peak over time suggests that the Aβ molecules are transitioning from the monomeric form to protofibrils.\nThe experiment involves comparing Aβ 1-40wt (wild-type) and Aβ 1-40Arc (variant or mutated form) at different time points (5, 45, and 125 minutes) of incubation. The initial concentrations of Aβ 1-40wt and Aβ 1-40Arc were 143 μM and 138 μM, respectively.\n\n8.2.1 Formation 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of A\\(\beta\\) Proteins\n\n\n\n\nThe aggregation of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide in Alzheimer’s disease follows a stepwise process involving different stages:\n\nMonomer Formation: Initially, individual Aβ molecules exist as monomers. These monomers slowly come together to form low-number soluble oligomers.\nOligomerization: The soluble oligomers acquire a specific aggregation number, indicating a defined number of Aβ molecules coming together. At this stage, they can form spherical or annular (ring-shaped) oligomers.\nProtofibril Formation: As more oligomers assemble, they transition into more ordered structures known as protofibrils. Protofibrils have a distinct β-sheet structure, which is a particular arrangement of amino acids in the protein.\nFibril Elongation: Protofibrils can elongate into more stable and structured fibrils. These fibrils are protease-resistant, meaning they are less susceptible to being broken down by enzymes.\n\nThe final result of this stepwise process is the formation of fibrils, which are fibrous structures. These fibrils are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease and contribute to the characteristic plaques.\n\n\n8.2.2 Formation 2\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information on the Formation of A\\(\beta\\) Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanism of amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathogenesis follows a nucleated polymerization pathway. Here’s a breakdown of this process:\n\nNucleated Polymerization Pathway: Aβ aggregation begins with a nucleated polymerization pathway. This pathway is characterized by distinct phases in the formation of amyloid fibrils.\nInitial Lag Phase: The process starts with an initial lag phase dominated by monomeric constituents. During this phase, Aβ molecules exist as individual monomers without significant aggregation.\nConformational Shift to β Sheet: Following the lag phase, there is an unfavorable conformational shift in the Aβ molecules. This shift involves a change in the structure of the proteins, adopting a β-sheet conformation. β-sheet structures are characteristic of amyloid fibrils.\nAssembly into Oligomeric “Nuclei”: The monomers then assemble into oligomeric “nuclei.” These nuclei serve as critical building blocks for the formation of higher-order structures.\nFormation of Protofibrils: The oligomeric nuclei assemble into higher-order protofibrils. Protofibrils are intermediate structures in the aggregation process, forming larger assemblies of Aβ molecules.\nCooperative and Rapid Elongation: The nucleus cooperatively and rapidly elongates through the addition of monomers into the growing protein polymer. This elongation follows a sigmoidal kinetic curve, indicating a cooperative and accelerating process.\n\nThis entire process leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils, which are long, insoluble fibers that aggregate together. These fibrils are a key component of the characteristic plaques found in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease."

    "text": "8.3 A\\(\\beta\\) Toxicity in Alzheimer’s Disease\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of Lipid Rafts\n\n\n\n\nThe amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrates a notable affinity for interacting with negatively charged lipids. This interaction takes place within specialized microdomains of the cell membrane known as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are distinct regions characterized by their rigidity and unique lipid composition, including gangliosides (GM), cholesterol, and sphingomyelin. These microdomains serve as platforms where various cellular processes occur, and the specific lipids present contribute to their unique properties.\nThe lipid raft microenvironment is crucial for understanding the molecular dynamics associated with Aβ. The peptide’s binding to negatively charged lipids within the lipid rafts is a key aspect of its aggregation process. Gangliosides, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin in lipid rafts create an environment conducive to Aβ interactions. This interaction plays a role in the aggregation of Aβ, a process that contributes to the formation of plaques in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n8.3.1 Mechanisms\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism of Assembly\n\n\n\n\nThe process by which amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathogenesis involves a two-step molecular mechanism that disrupts cellular membranes. When Aβ is introduced to a solution containing cellular membranes, it binds to the membrane and forms ion channel-like pores. This initial step suggests a direct impact on the integrity of the cellular membrane, creating openings or channels. The appearance of these Aβ pores is notably enhanced in the presence of gangliosides, a specific type of glycolipid found in cell membranes. Gangliosides play a crucial role in mediating a second step of membrane disruption, acting in a detergent-like manner to fragment the lipid bilayer. This two-step mechanism sheds light on the intricate processes through which Aβ can compromise the structural integrity of cellular membranes, potentially contributing to the overall pathology of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\n8.3.2 Metal Ion Homeostasis\nIn the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the mode of toxicity of amyloid beta (Aβ) involves disrupting the homeostasis of essential transition metal ions, specifically zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe). These metal ions play crucial physiological roles in the brain, contributing to healthy brain function. Their levels are typically tightly regulated by the blood–brain barrier (BBB), ensuring proper functioning.\nZinc and copper, in particular, are involved in the communication of information between neurons at synapses. For example, Zn(II) is co-released with the neurotransmitter glutamate during neuronal stimulation. Subsequently, Zn is taken up by calcium (Ca(II)) channels, participating in various intracellular signaling events critical for neuronal function.\nHowever, in AD, the aggregation of Aβ is often associated with abnormal levels of Zn, Cu, and Fe. Aβ plaques, characteristic of AD pathology, show specific associations with these metal ions. The concentration of metal ions required for Aβ plaque formation is notable, with 0.9 mM for iron, 0.4 mM for copper, and 1 mM for zinc.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordiantion with Metal Ions\n\n\n\n\nCu2+ exhibits a high affinity for binding to Aβ, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 4 femtomolars (fM). This strong binding between Cu2+ and Aβ plays a crucial role in the toxicity associated with AD.\nThe interaction between Cu2+ and Aβ accelerates the formation of fibrils and β-sheet structures within the Aβ peptide. These structural changes are characteristic of Aβ aggregation and are linked to the development of plaques in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. The high affinity binding of Cu2+ to Aβ contributes to the aggregation of Aβ into insoluble fibrils, leading to the formation of toxic deposits in the brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopper in Alzheimer’s Disease\n\n\n\n\nNotably, copper does not seem to influence the lag phase of the kinetics. The lag phase represents the initial stage during which monomeric Aβ molecules slowly assemble into low-number soluble oligomers. In the presence of copper, the nucleation events during this lag phase remain unchanged, indicating that copper does not impact the early stages of Aβ aggregation.\nHowever, copper does play a catalytic role in the elongation phase of the kinetics. The elongation phase involves the cooperative and rapid growth of Aβ aggregates through the addition of monomers into the growing protein polymer. In the presence of copper, this elongation phase is facilitated or catalyzed, suggesting that copper influences the later stages of Aβ aggregation, contributing to the formation of larger, more structured aggregates.\n\n\n8.3.3 ROS Creation\nIn Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the brains of affected individuals exhibit significant levels of ‘Oxidative Stress.’ This condition arises from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), also known as free radicals, and the body’s ability to counteract or neutralize their harmful effects. One notable aspect of oxidative stress in AD is the limited presence of antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C, as well as glutathione, which are essential for combating oxidative damage.\nThe brains of individuals with AD also contain products that indicate oxidative damage at the molecular level. Examples include 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative damage to DNA, and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation. These indicators reflect the impact of oxidative stress on crucial cellular components, such as DNA and lipids, in the brains of AD patients.\nAdditionally, amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, central to AD pathology, directly contribute to oxidative stress by promoting the generation of free radicals. This further exacerbates the oxidative imbalance in the brain, creating a harmful cycle that can contribute to the progression of the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed Steps in ROS Creation\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed consequences of the excessive binding of heme with amyloid beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer’s Disease suggest a sequence of events that link heme, Aβ production, and oxidative stress in the brain.\n\nHeme Synthesis and Export: Heme is initially synthesized in the mitochondria and is then exported to the cytosol to join the regulatory heme (step 1). In the cytosol, heme plays a role in various metabolic activities (step 2).\nIncreased Aβ Production in AD: In the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, there is an elevated production of Aβ resulting from the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (step 3). Aβ is a peptide implicated in the formation of plaques, a characteristic feature of AD pathology.\nHeme’s Role in Preventing Aβ Aggregation: Interestingly, heme is identified as a factor that prevents the aggregation of Aβ (step 4). In this context, heme seems to play a regulatory role in modulating Aβ aggregation, possibly influencing the progression of AD.\nExcessive Aβ Binding Depletes Regulatory Heme: However, when there is an excessive level of Aβ, it leads to the depletion of the regulatory heme (step 5). This imbalance creates a state of heme deficiency in the cell.\nFormation of Aβ–Heme Peroxidase and Oxidative Stress: The heme-deficient state results in the excess formation of Aβ–heme peroxidase, which contributes to oxidative stress in AD. This oxidative stress is a detrimental condition where there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the cell’s ability to neutralize them, ultimately contributing to the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Post-Translational Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Translational Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Translational Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Translational Modifications\n\n\n\n\nIn a study examining the phosphorylation of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ), primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons were incubated with synthetic Aβ and [γ‐32P]ATP. The results indicated that Aβ was readily phosphorylated in the presence of neurons. Importantly, no radiolabeling was observed in the absence of cells, suggesting the involvement of an ecto‐protein kinase located on the surface of neurons. This finding implies the existence of a kinase at the neuron’s outer membrane capable of phosphorylating extracellular Aβ.\nFurthermore, the study revealed that Aβ was not detected in the corresponding cell lysates. This observation suggests that Aβ did not internalize into the cells, ruling out the possibility of being phosphorylated by intracellular kinases. The phosphorylation event was, therefore, attributed to the extracellular environment.\nIn-silico analysis, a computational approach, identified a serine residue at position 8 (Ser8) within a potential recognition motif (R‐x‐x‐S) for protein kinase A (PKA). This motif suggests that PKA, a cellular kinase, may be involved in phosphorylating Aβ at the Ser8 site. The in-silico analysis provides a molecular insight into the potential mechanisms of Aβ phosphorylation on the cell surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation Again\n\n\n\n\n(A) Two-Phase Kinetics of Aβ Aggregation: The aggregation process of amyloid beta (Aβ) involves two distinct kinetic phases. In the ‘lag phase,’ there is a slow formation of oligomeric nuclei, depicted by the dashed lines. These oligomeric nuclei are crucial intermediates in the aggregation pathway. Following the lag phase, the ‘elongation phase’ ensues, marked by a straight line. During this phase, the oligomeric nuclei promote the formation of fibrils, representing a more rapid and ordered aggregation process.\n(B) Phosphorylation Shortens Lag Phase: Phosphorylation of Aβ has a notable effect on the kinetics of aggregation. Specifically, phosphorylation reduces the ‘lag phase’ duration in comparison to non-phosphorylated Aβ (npAβ). The lag phase, characterized by the slow formation of oligomeric nuclei, is expedited when Aβ is phosphorylated. This modification suggests that phosphorylation influences the early stages of Aβ aggregation, potentially by altering the nucleation process.\n(C) Seed Effect of pSAβ Nuclei: In the context of phosphorylated Aβ (pSAβ), the nuclei formed during its aggregation process could act as seeds to accelerate the aggregation of non-phosphorylated Aβ (npAβ). This implies that the oligomeric nuclei generated from phosphorylated Aβ may serve as templates or inducers for the more rapid aggregation of non-phosphorylated Aβ. This seed effect highlights a potential cross-interaction between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of Aβ in the aggregation process."

    "text": "8.4 Inhibiting Amyloid Formation\n\n8.4.1 Using Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeting A\\(\beta\\) Using Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeting A\\(\beta\\) Using Antibodies\n\n\n\n\nAntibodies targeting A-beta amyloids, the protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, offer potential avenues for therapeutic intervention due to the immunogenic nature of the Aβ peptide. Both the N- and C-termini of Aβ can elicit an immunogenic response.\nThree different mechanisms of action are proposed for Aβ-targeted immunotherapy:\n(a) Peripheral Sink Hypothesis: One mechanism involves the peripheral sink hypothesis. Antibodies binding to monomeric Aβ in the periphery, such as in the bloodstream, can alter the equilibrium and transport of Aβ across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This disruption in Aβ transport may influence the overall distribution and accumulation of Aβ in the brain.\n(b) Direct Interference with Aggregation: Antibodies that can cross the BBB and enter the central nervous system (CNS) might directly interfere with the aggregation process of Aβ. By targeting Aβ within the brain, these antibodies aim to modulate or prevent the formation of toxic aggregates, potentially slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\n(c) Clearance of Amyloid Plaques: Another mechanism involves antibodies recognizing amyloid fibrils. Antibodies binding to amyloid fibrils can trigger the clearance of plaques through Fc-mediated phagocytosis. This process involves immune cells engulfing and removing the Aβ-containing plaques, offering a potential means of reducing the burden of Aβ aggregates in the brain.\n\n\n8.4.2 Using Affibodies\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Affibodies\n\n\n\n\nThe targeting of A-beta amyloids using Affibody involves a unique approach utilizing a three-helix bundle protein known as the Z domain. This cysteine-free three-helix bundle domain, consisting of 58 amino acids, serves as a scaffold for constructing combinatorial phagemid libraries. These libraries are generated using phage display technology, allowing the selection of specific Affibody variants designed to target desired molecules, including A-beta amyloids.\nThe Z domain provides a stable and well-defined structure, making it an ideal scaffold for creating diverse Affibody variants through combinatorial libraries. Affibodies are small engineered proteins designed for high-affinity binding to specific target molecules, and their selection is facilitated by the phage display technique, where the phage particles display Affibody variants on their surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of Affibodies\n\n\n\n\nThe interaction between the Aβ peptide and the Affibody involves a specific structural aspect of the Aβ peptide. A portion of the Aβ peptide forms a β-hairpin structure when in complex with the Affibody. This segment of Aβ that adopts the β-hairpin structure is notably hydrophobic, contributing to the formation of the nucleus of aggregation. In the context of Alzheimer’s disease, the aggregation of Aβ into plaques is a hallmark feature, and the hydrophobic β-hairpin structure plays a role in initiating this process.\nThe Affibody, by binding to the β-hairpin region of the Aβ peptide, exerts a modulating effect on its structure. This binding event acts as a lock, inhibiting the elongation of the Aβ structure. By preventing further growth or elongation of the Aβ aggregate, the Affibody may play a crucial role in disrupting the aggregation process, potentially mitigating the formation of larger, more complex structures associated with Alzheimer’s pathology.\nThis targeted interaction between the Affibody and the hydrophobic β-hairpin region of Aβ highlights a potential therapeutic strategy for influencing the aggregation dynamics of Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease. By precisely locking specific structural elements, such as the β-hairpin, therapeutic interventions may aim to modulate the progression of Aβ aggregation and the associated neurodegenerative processes.\n\n\n8.4.3 Peptide Based Inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide-Based Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide-Based Inhibition\n\n\n\n\nThe interaction between Aβ molecules during polymer growth and fibril formation is a critical aspect of the pathological processes associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The Aβ molecules, depicted in gray, likely engage in interactions through one or several binding sequences (A) during the growth of polymers and the formation of fibrils. Understanding these binding sequences is crucial for developing targeted interventions.\nIt is reasonable to assume that ligands, represented in black, capable of binding to these specific sequences on the Aβ molecules have the potential to interrupt or arrest further Aβ polymerization (B). By disrupting the binding sequences involved in the polymerization process, these ligands may prevent the aggregation of Aβ into larger, more complex structures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide Inhibitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide Inhibitions\n\n\n\n\nProteins that possess a similar β-sheet structure to Aβ may have the capability to bind to Aβ in a manner akin to Aβ itself. The shared structural elements, particularly the β-sheet structure, can serve as common recognition sites for binding. This suggests that proteins with similar structural motifs may interact with Aβ, potentially influencing its behavior or contributing to the aggregation process.\nIn the context of protein surface engineering, there is an opportunity to create high-affinity binding sites specifically designed for Aβ. Through surface engineering, two or more binding elements for the Aβ molecule can be strategically incorporated into the protein structure. This approach allows for the precise modification of protein surfaces to enhance their interaction with Aβ, potentially increasing the specificity and strength of the binding.\nMoreover, considering the dynamic and reversible nature of Aβ polymerization, ligands that target the binding sequences may not only inhibit further polymerization but also have the potential to dissolve existing Aβ polymers in situ. This suggests a possible therapeutic avenue where ligands could actively intervene in the aggregation process, either preventing the formation of new fibrils or destabilizing existing ones."

    "title": "9  Antibiotic Resistance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Mechanism of Antibiotic Resistance\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the world of resistance mechanisms, a fascinating realm where bacteria develop strategies to withstand antibiotics. To understand this, let’s focus on an example involving β-lactam antibiotics, which aim to tackle bacteria by targeting a crucial protein known as penicillin-binding protein (PBP).\nIn the bacterial battleground, Antibiotic A is like a stealthy intruder. It enters the bacterial cell through a special protein called a porin, which acts like a gate. Once inside, Antibiotic A reaches its target, the PBP, and effectively puts a halt to peptidoglycan synthesis – an essential process for bacterial survival.\nNow, let’s meet Antibiotic B. It also has the ability to enter the bacterial cell via a porin, just like its counterpart, Antibiotic A. However, Antibiotic B faces a different challenge. It’s not just about getting in; it’s about staying in. Antibiotic B, despite entering the cell, encounters a defense mechanism known as efflux, a process that efficiently kicks it out. So, Antibiotic B has a harder time doing its job compared to Antibiotic A.\nLastly, let’s talk about Antibiotic C. Unfortunately, Antibiotic C faces a major roadblock. It cannot cross the outer membrane of the bacterial cell. Imagine it as a key that can’t fit into the lock – Antibiotic C is unable to access the target protein, PBP, and therefore cannot disrupt peptidoglycan synthesis.\n\n\nLet’s unravel the complexities of antibiotics, using Triclosan as an example. Triclosan is a powerful weapon against various bacteria, particularly those belonging to the Gram-positive group and many Gram-negative ones. However, it faces a tough opponent in the form of the Gram-negative Pseudomonas bacteria.\nTriclosan’s strength lies in its ability to disrupt fatty acid synthesis by inhibiting a key enzyme called enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase. This interference hampers the growth of susceptible bacteria, but here’s where the plot thickens.\nEnter Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium with a resilience that baffles Triclosan. Within P. aeruginosa, there are two forms of enoyl-ACP reductase – FabI and FabV. While Triclosan can successfully tackle FabI, it faces resistance from FabV.\n\n\nFirstly, Gram-negative bacteria have a distinct feature – their plasma membrane contains fewer anionic phospholipids compared to Gram-positive bacteria. This difference plays a role in how antibiotics interact with these bacterial types. Take Daptomycin, for example. This antibiotic effectively inserts itself into the plasma membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, especially with the assistance of calcium ions.\nHowever, Gram-negative bacteria present a tougher challenge for many antibiotics. Why? Their outer membrane acts as a formidable barrier, making it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate and do their job. It’s like a protective shield that some antibiotics struggle to breach.\nNow, let’s talk about the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. This antibiotic is a specialist in inhibiting peptidoglycan crosslinking, a crucial process for bacterial survival. However, there’s a catch. Vancomycin works like a charm in Gram-positive bacteria by binding to specific peptides. Yet, in the world of Gram-negative organisms, it faces a hurdle – the outer membrane. Vancomycin struggles to cross this membrane and access the peptides in the periplasm, making it less effective against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermeability of the Outer Membrane\n\n\n\n\nGuarding Against Antibiotics:\nNow, let’s explore how bacteria have developed strategies to defend themselves against antibiotics. One effective method involves reducing the permeability of the outer membrane, essentially making it harder for antibiotics to enter the bacterial cell.\nThis defense mechanism operates through the downregulation of porins or the substitution of porins with more selective channels. Think of porins as gatekeepers that control what gets in and out of the bacterial cell. When these porins are downregulated or replaced with channels that are more discerning, it limits the entry of antibiotics into the bacterial fortress.\nThe significance of this defense becomes even more apparent when considering newer drugs like carbapenems and cephalosporins. These drugs face resistance when porin expression is reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of the Outer Membrane and Drugs\n\n\n\n\nImagine the outer membrane (OM) of bacteria as a well-organized layer, and within this structure, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play a crucial role in defense. LPS acts like a steric trap, creating a barrier that challenges the entry of certain drugs.\nHere’s how it works: hydrophobic drugs, those that don’t mix well with water, find it difficult to penetrate the hydrophilic (water-loving) sugar layers of LPS. It’s like trying to move through a dense forest where the trees are made of sugar – there’s a lack of interaction, and the drugs struggle to get through.\nBut that’s not the only defense mechanism at play. LPS doesn’t just create a barrier; it also orchestrates the formation of aggregations. When lipophilic drugs, which have an affinity for fats, interact with LPS, they form high molecular weight aggregates. This interaction creates larger structures that, much like a roadblock, prevent the drugs from crossing the OM."

    "section": "9.2 Resistance Mechanisms",
    "text": "9.2 Resistance Mechanisms\n\n9.2.1 Antibiotic Efflux Pumps\n\n\n\n\n\nExpression of Antibiotic Efflux Pumps\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Dance of Resistance:\nInside the intricate world of bacteria, a specific set of actors called Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) efflux pumps takes center stage. These pumps play a key role in resisting various drugs, and their baseline expression is like a carefully choreographed dance.\nPicture a TetR family repressor acting as a local director, controlling the initial expression of RND pumps. This director ensures that the levels are not too high, maintaining a baseline. Now, here’s where the plot thickens. Enter the AraC family transcription factor, ready to relieve the repression orchestrated by TetR. However, the levels of this factor are intentionally kept low. Why? Because another character, the multiple antibiotic resistance protein (MarR) family repressor, steps in to keep the AraC factor in check.\nNow, let’s break it down. The baseline expression of RND efflux pumps is controlled by TetR, and AraC, capable of amplifying this expression, is kept in check by MarR. It’s like a molecular ballet where different elements interact to maintain a delicate balance.\nZooming out, the RND family of multi-drug-resistant efflux pumps is a significant player, especially in Gram-negative bacteria. When these pumps are kicked into overdrive, they confer clinically relevant levels of multi-drug resistance. It’s as if the bacteria, equipped with these pumps, can export an incredibly wide range of substances, making them formidable adversaries in the realm of antibiotic resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nMutations Associated with Efflux Pumps\n\n\n\n\nIn the intricate world of bacterial genetics, mutations can rewrite the script of resistance mechanisms. Let’s zoom in on two key characters: the marR family repressor and the TetR family repressor.\nImagine the marR family repressor gene as a master regulator, normally preventing the AraC family transcription factor from taking center stage. However, when mutations occur in this gene, the repressor loses its grip, allowing AraC to shine. This increased expression of AraC sets off a chain reaction, leading to heightened expression of the RND efflux pump AcrB and its partner, the periplasmic adaptor AcrA. It’s like a genetic switch has been flipped, unleashing the machinery that pumps up the bacterial defenses.\nNow, shift your focus to the lower panel of this genetic narrative. Picture the TetR family repressor gene as a guardian, usually binding upstream of acrA and acrB to keep their activity in check. However, a mutation in this gene changes the game. The repressor can no longer bind effectively, reducing its control over acrA and acrB. This genetic hiccup results in increased transcription of acrAB, further contributing to the escalation of the RND efflux pump’s activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotic Binding\n\n\n\n\nIn the bacterial saga of resistance, antibiotics play a surprising role in the plot. Picture a key character named MarR, a repressor that usually keeps the AraC transcription factor in check. However, when antibiotics enter the scene, they bind to MarR and bring about changes in its structure. This binding event serves as a trigger, causing MarR to undergo conformational changes.\nNow, here’s the twist: these conformational changes in MarR prevent it from carrying out its repression duties on the AraC transcription factor. With the repressor disarmed, AraC is free to step into the spotlight. The increased expression of AraC sets off a cascade of events, leading to a surge in the transcription of acrA and acrB.\nIn simpler terms, antibiotics act like a switch that flips the script of bacterial resistance. By binding to MarR, they disrupt its usual repression of AraC, allowing the AraC factor to unleash higher expression levels of acrA and acrB. It’s as if antibiotics, in addition to their direct action on bacteria, have a secondary effect of revealing and boosting the bacterial defense mechanisms.\n\n9.2.1.1 TolC, AcrA, and AcrB\n\n\n\n\n\n3D Structure of an Efflux Pump\n\n\n\n\nPicture this: within the complex world of bacteria, there’s a dynamic trio working together to create a robust defense system. Let’s meet TolC, AcrA, and AcrB – the key players in the Gram-negative E. coli’s multidrug efflux system AcrAB–TolC.\nFirst up is TolC, a channel in the outer membrane that acts like a gateway. Think of it as the first line of defense, controlling what goes in and out. Next is AcrA, a crucial linker that forms the bridge between TolC and AcrB. It’s like the connector ensuring seamless communication and collaboration between the outer and inner parts of the bacterial cell.\nNow, let’s dive into the inner workings of the cell, where AcrB takes center stage. Residing in the inner membrane, AcrB is the powerhouse of the operation. It binds to substances and uses the energy from the proton motive force to drive the expulsion of drugs. It’s a bit like a molecular pump, actively pushing unwanted substances out of the bacterial fortress.\nIn the grand X-ray picture of this tripartite system, you can see AcrB (in blue) doing its job in the inner membrane. It captures drugs at the outer leaflet of the inner membrane and expels them in tandem with protons. TolC (in yellow) forms a pore in the outer membrane, acting as the exit point for expelled substances and extending into the periplasmic space.\nAcrA (in red) plays a crucial role in mediating contact between AcrB and TolC, ensuring the seamless operation of the entire system. Importantly, the presence of all three components – TolC, AcrA, and AcrB – is vital for the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, making this trio a formidable defense mechanism against various drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of the Efflux Pumps\n\n\n\n\nImagine peering into the microscopic world of bacterial defense, specifically at the AcrB trimer – a trio of molecular performers crucial for drug resistance. In this side-view schematic, each of the three monomers of the AcrB trimer reveals distinct conformational states: loose (L) in blue, tight (T) in yellow, and open (O) in red.\nNow, let’s focus on the L and T monomers, where lateral grooves indicate substrate binding sites. Picture these grooves as specific docking stations where substrates, like acridine, can attach. The different geometric forms within these grooves represent the varying affinities for transported substrates – low affinity (triangle), high affinity (rectangle), or no affinity (circle).\nHere’s where the molecular ballet unfolds: in the first state of the cycle, a monomer in the L conformation binds a substrate in its transmembrane domain. It then gracefully transports the substrate to the hydrophobic binding pocket, transforming into the T conformation. In the final act, the monomer transitions to the O conformation, releasing the substrate into a funnel toward TolC.\nEnter AcrA, the supporting dancer in this molecular performance. AcrA plays a crucial role in transmitting conformational changes from AcrB to TolC. This intricate dance, orchestrated by AcrA, results in the opening of the TolC channel, creating a pathway for drug extrusion to the outside of the bacterial cell.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Mutation Changing Antibiotic Targets\n\n\n\n\n\nMutation Changing Antibiotic Targets\n\n\n\n\nIn the microbial world, bacteria have developed ingenious tactics to resist the effects of antibiotics. One common approach is through mutations in the target site, such as those seen in topoisomerase genes across various species, leading to resistance against fluoroquinolones. Another method involves recombination, creating mosaic alleles in penicillin-binding proteins found in pneumococci and gonococci, conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. In both cases, these changes result in a functional target with reduced affinity for antibiotics, making it less responsive to their effects.\nA different strategy involves modifying the antibiotic target by adding a chemical group. This modification doesn’t alter the primary protein sequence of the target, allowing it to retain its normal activity. However, the addition of the chemical group prevents the antibiotic from efficiently binding to the target, diminishing or nullifying its effectiveness.\n\n9.2.2.1 Target Protection\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Protection\n\n\n\n\nBacteria employ various strategies to shield themselves from the effects of antibiotics. One notable defense is through target protection mechanisms. In the case of the erythromycin ribosome methylase (erm) family of genes, they methylate the 16S rRNA, causing alterations in the drug-binding site. This modification prevents the binding of antibiotics like macrolides, lincosamines, and streptogramins, rendering them ineffective.\nAnother player in the resistance game is the chloramphenicol–florfenicol resistance (cfr) methyltransferase. This enzyme specifically methylates A2503 in the 23S rRNA. This modification provides resistance against a broad spectrum of drugs that target sites near A2503, including phenicols and pleuromutilins.\nIn a different arena, the qnr families of quinolone resistance genes have been discovered on plasmids in various pathogens. These genes contribute to resistance against quinolone antibiotics, creating an additional layer of protection.\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Hydrolysis\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrolysis Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nBacteria showcase a remarkable defense strategy known as inactivation by hydrolysis, where a variety of bacterial enzymes come into play to either degrade or modify different classes of antibiotics. This enzymatic activity is particularly widespread and effective against various antibiotic types, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, phenicols, and macrolides.\nIn the case of β-lactam antibiotics, a diverse array of bacterial enzymes called β-lactamases takes center stage. This enzyme family is proficient in hydrolyzing a range of β-lactam antibiotics, which include well-known drugs like penicillins, cephalosporins, clavams, carbapenems, and monobactams. Through hydrolysis, these β-lactamases effectively break down the β-lactam ring present in these antibiotics, rendering them inactive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Site of Antibiotics\n\n\n\n\nIn the intricate world of bacterial enzymes, subtle changes in their genetic makeup, known as point mutations, play a crucial role in modulating their substrate spectra. Two key positions, 167 and 240, emerge as hotspots for amino acid substitutions that enhance the enzyme’s activity. These positions are strategically located either in the omega-loop, at the bottom of the binding site, or in the terminal part of the β3 β-strand on the right side of the binding site.\nLet’s delve into the details. The substitution of Asp240 with Gly is expected to increase the flexibility of the β3 β-strand. This modification aims to render the enzyme’s active site more accessible, especially to bulkier antibiotics. It’s like adjusting the molecular structure to accommodate a wider range of antibiotics, enhancing the enzyme’s efficiency.\nOn the other hand, the substitution of Pro167 with Ser, located in the omega-loop, has a different impact. This modification alters the mode of interaction between the enzyme and beta-lactam antibiotics in the binding site. The result is improved recognition of antibiotics, allowing the enzyme to more effectively interact with and modify these molecules.\n\n\n9.2.4 Transfer of a Chemical Group\nBacteria employ a sophisticated defense mechanism called inactivation by the transfer of a chemical group. This process involves the transfer of various chemical groups, such as acyl, phosphate, nucleotidyl, and ribitoyl groups, onto antibiotics. The responsible enzymes form a large and diverse family of antibiotic-resistance enzymes.\nAminoglycoside antibiotics are particularly susceptible to this type of modification. These antibiotics, characterized by their large molecular size and numerous exposed hydroxyl and amide groups, provide ample sites for chemical group transfer. The enzymes responsible for this modification have the ability to bind to aminoglycosides at their active sites, effectively mimicking the target environment of the ribosomal binding cleft.\nThe remarkable feature of these resistance enzymes lies in their broad substrate specificity. This flexibility is attributed to the adaptability of the enzyme’s structure and the size of its active site. Due to this adaptability, these enzymes can recognize and modify a wide range of antibiotic molecules.\n\n\n9.2.5 Solutions to Resistance?\nHost Defense Peptides (HDPs), also known as Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs), represent a fascinating and versatile solution in the ongoing battle against microbial resistance.\nThese peptides are not confined to a specific group of organisms; they are found across the spectrum of life, from bacteria to humans. One notable characteristic of AMPs is their relatively short length, typically ranging from 10 to 50 amino acids. Despite their brevity, these peptides exhibit a broad spectrum of activity, making them effective against a wide array of pathogens.\nThe diversity of AMPs is reflected in the approximately 3500 AMPs cataloged in databases, emphasizing the richness of these naturally occurring defense mechanisms. If you’re interested, the AMP database can be explored at http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.html.\nIn mammals, including humans, AMPs play a crucial role in the innate immune system. They contribute to defense through direct killing of pathogens and by modulating the immune response. This dual functionality enhances the host’s ability to combat infections effectively.\nAntimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) exhibit distinct features that contribute to their effectiveness in combating pathogens. Here are some key characteristics:\n\nCationic Nature: AMPs are often positively charged (cationic), which allows them to interact favorably with the negatively charged surfaces of microbial membranes. This interaction is crucial for disrupting the integrity of the microbial cell membrane.\nAliphatic Amino Acids: AMPs frequently have a high content of aliphatic amino acids, including leucine (Leu), valine (Val), isoleucine (Ile), and alanine (Ala). These amino acids contribute to the overall structure and function of AMPs.\nPreference for Aromatic Amino Acids: AMPs commonly contain aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Trp), and phenylalanine (Phe). These aromatic residues play a role in interactions with microbial membranes and contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the peptides.\nDisulfide Bonds: Some AMPs contain disulfide bonds (S-S bonds), which contribute to the stability and structural integrity of the peptides. These bonds can enhance resistance to enzymatic degradation and provide structural support."

    "text": "9.3 Bacterial Cell Killing\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to KIll Bacterial Cells\n\n\n\n\nAntimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) employ a multifaceted approach in the killing of bacterial cells. The process begins with the binding of AMPs to the bacterial membrane, facilitated by their cationic nature, allowing interaction with the negatively charged components of the microbial membrane. Following this initial interaction, AMPs proceed to disrupt the integrity of the bacterial membrane through diverse mechanisms. This disruption can manifest as the formation of pores or disturbances in the lipid bilayer, ultimately compromising the structural integrity of the microbial cell.\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Membrane Specificity\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets AMPs apart is their lower likelihood of resistance development compared to traditional antibiotics. Their broader spectrum of activity allows them to disrupt multiple microbial functions simultaneously, making it challenging for bacteria to develop resistance against them. Beyond membrane disruption, some AMPs demonstrate the ability to enter bacterial cells. Once inside, they target essential components such as DNA, ribosomes, and proteins, providing an additional layer of efficacy against a variety of pathogens.\n\n9.3.1 Disruption by AMPs\n\n\n\n\n\nKilling P. aeruginosa\n\n\n\n\nThe disruptive action of Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) on bacterial membranes is vividly illustrated in experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 exposed to the ovine cathelicidin SMAP29. At a concentration of 10 μg ml−1, SMAP29 was incubated with P. aeruginosa PAO1 for varying durations. Microscopic analysis revealed compelling visual evidence of the membrane disruption process.\nIn the initial stages, specific antibodies and protein A colloidal gold labeling demonstrated the attachment of SMAP29 to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. This binding is highlighted by an arrow in the left panel of the images. As the incubation progressed to 1.5 hours, SMAP29 induced the formation of blebs on the microbial surface. These blebs, visible in the middle panel, started protruding from the microbial surface, indicating the disruptive impact of SMAP29.\nBy the 3-hour mark, the membrane-disruptive action of SMAP29 became even more pronounced. The blebs continued to grow, and in cross-section, they appeared as electron-dense material attached to the microbial surface. This is evident in the right panel, where the arrow points to the electron-dense material associated with the microbial surface.\n\n9.3.1.1 The Underlying Mechanism\nThe first step is Attraction, where AMPs are drawn to bacterial surfaces. Electrostatic bonding, particularly between cationic peptides and structures on the bacterial surface, is a key mechanism driving this attraction.\nFollowing attraction, the next step is Attachment. When in close proximity to the microbial surface, peptides must navigate through capsular polysaccharides. This step is essential for interacting with the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, which contains lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and traversing capsular polysaccharides, teichoic acids, and lipoteichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria before reaching the cytoplasmic membrane.\nThe subsequent step is Peptide Insertion and Membrane Permeability. Initially, at low peptide/lipid ratios, peptides bind parallel to the lipid bilayer. As the peptide/lipid ratio increases, peptides shift to a perpendicular orientation. At high peptide/lipid ratios, peptides insert into the bilayer, forming transmembrane pores known as the I state. The characteristics of the I state vary based on the peptide and target lipid composition, and multiple models have been proposed to explain the membrane permeabilization process.\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Barrel-Stave Model of AMP-Induced Killing\n\n\n\n\n\nBacterial Cell Killing\n\n\n\n\nObserved in the hydrophobic Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) Alamethicin, a fungal peptide, is a unique mechanism of action distinct from traditional cationic AMPs. Alamethicin lacks cationic amino acids and is primarily composed of polar amino acids. Despite this distinction, Alamethicin exerts its antimicrobial effect by forming ion channels within the bacterial membrane.\nThe process begins with the peptides binding to the membrane through hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of aggregates. Notably, Alamethicin undergoes a change in orientation during this process. Initially attached to the membrane surface, the hydrophobic (blue) regions of the peptide align with the lipid core of the membrane, facilitating deeper penetration. Simultaneously, the hydrophilic (red) regions of the peptide contribute to the formation of an interior pore within the membrane, creating a channel.\n\n\n9.3.3 Toroidal Pore Model of AMP-Induced Killing\n\n\n\n\n\nToroidal Pore Model of AMP-Induced Killing\n\n\n\n\nThe Toroidal Pore Model provides insights into the mode of bacterial cell killing induced by certain cationic Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs), exemplified by long AMPs like Magainin and LL37. This model describes a stepwise process that many of these AMPs follow to disrupt bacterial membranes and induce cell death.\nThe process initiates with the electrostatic binding of peptides to the bacterial membrane. Multiple peptides attach to the membrane surface through electrostatic interactions.\nUpon reaching a critical concentration of AMPs, a key transition occurs. The attached peptides induce continuous bending of the lipid monolayers, leading to the formation of a pore. This bending is a crucial step in the toroidal pore model.\nAs peptides aggregate along with the bent lipids, the lipid head groups interact with the cationic residues (depicted in red) of the AMPs. Simultaneously, the hydrophobic chains of lipids align with the non-polar face (depicted in blue) of the AMPs.\nThe overall arrangement of AMPs and the membrane forms a toroidal pore. This pore structure ensures that the water core is lined by both the inserted peptides and the lipid head groups.\n\n\n9.3.4 Carpet Model of Antimicrobial Induced Killing\n\n\n\n\n\nCarpet Model of Killing Bacteria\n\n\n\n\nThe Carpet Model provides a distinct perspective on the mode of bacterial cell killing induced by certain cationic Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs). This mode is often observed in shorter AMPs, typically those with fewer than 20 amino acids, although it is not exclusive to them. Examples of AMPs that follow the Carpet Model include temporins and ovispirin.\nThe process begins with the electrostatic binding of peptides to the bacterial membrane, similar to the Toroidal Pore Model. Peptides accumulate on the bilayer surface, staying consistently parallel to the membrane surface.\nIn this model, AMPs are electrostatically attracted to the anionic phospholipid head groups that cover the membrane surface. The accumulation of peptides in a carpet-like manner creates high strain on the bilayer structure of the membrane.\nSurface-oriented peptides, arranged in a carpet-like fashion, are believed to disrupt the bilayer in a detergent-like manner. This disruption eventually leads to the formation of micelles, which are small lipid aggregates. The detergent-like action of the AMPs on the membrane surface is thought to be a key mechanism in bacterial cell killing through the Carpet Model."

This event results in the creation of a modified chromosome 22 otherwise known as the Philadelphia chromosome. Nonetheless, this event also creates an abnormally active tyrosine kinase and ultimately, cancer.\nAs cancerous cells in CML patients all have the Philadelphia chromosome, this suggests the cells are derived from an ancestor.\nRandom Inactivation of X Chromosomes\nRandom X chromosomes are inactivated during one’s lifetime. In tumor tissue, the cancerous cells have the same (in)activated X chromosomes, hinting that the cancerous cells must derived from a common ancestor."

Could the cancer have been transmitted as a result of a virus or a microorganism?\n(hint: Tasmanian devils often fight by biting their opponent’s face and mouth.

We can deduce that the tumors all came from the same cancerous cell. A Tasmanian devil’s fighting style would likely inflict deep puncture wounds on their opponent - if the cancer were transmissible through bites (i.e., the cancerous cells could be transmitted via saliva), this could explain why the 11 Tasmanian devils karyotyped all have facial tumors with similar genetic abnormalities.\nThe cancer could have been transmitted by a microorganism, but this is unlikely. At least in the context of this course, viral proteins can cause cancer by affecting E2F and Rb’s interaction, but not in this manner."

When Rb is unphosphorylated, it binds to the transcription cofactor E2F (only when another protein called “DP” is present) to inhibit transcription.\nHowever, during mitosis, mitogens cause a regulatory protein p16 to unbind a kinase subunit called “CDK4”. CDK4 then binds to another subunit called “Cyclin D” to form a CDK4 / Cyclin D complex - this behaves as a kinase.\nThis complex then goes on to phosphorylate Rb - this, in turn, causes Rb to disassociate with E2F and allowing gene transcription."

Proliferating cells have a high ratio of ATP to ADP, and an enzyme calle adenylate kinase converts two ADP molecules into ATP and AMP. This elevated AMP amount in the cell then activates AMPK - an activity that is dependent on the tumor suppressor protein LKB1. LKB1 also leads to the phosphorylation of multiple targets and hence, a change in energy needs of the cell."

Without BOSS, there wouldn’t be anything to induce the development of R7 photoreceptor cells.\nThe offspring have overactive Ras mutations, but this won’t affect vision per se\nResearchers have already found out that an overactive Ras can still induce the development of the R7 photoreceptor cell even in the absence of the Sev gene or the BOSS protein.\nSo, while the flies’ visions may be unaffected, an overactive Ras protein could still trigger unwanted downstream signalling in other pathways."
